  Introduction 
1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of San Marino was held at the 6th meeting, on 29 October 2014. The delegation of San Marino was headed by Pasquale Valentini, Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on San Marino. 

2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of San Marino: Burkina Faso, Chile, China. 

3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of San Marino: 


(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/1); 
(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/2); 
(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/3). 
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to San Marino through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 


 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. The delegation of San Marino presented its report for the second cycle of the UPR on the human rights situation. 

6. The delegation noted that, in July 2014, it had presented the national report prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Health, Labour and Education and other government offices. It stated that the national report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first review, noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those recommendations.  

7. The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order. The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that, in the field of human rights, did not need internal implementation rules, as international law was an integral part of national law, and even superseded this in the event of any conflict.  

8. The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted. On 1 July 2010, San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 


in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing it. On 21 July 2011, it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). On 23 October 2013, it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and, on 5 September 2014, approved Law No. 138 on ÒRegulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of GenocideÓ. In recent years, San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments: the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse; the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. Furthermore, San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No. 16 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments. 

9. Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein, the delegation announced that, having ratified on 21 July 2011 the amendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute, on the crime of aggression, was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament.  

10. The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol. It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed, though, owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation, the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved, San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession. 

11. The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence, through the approval of Law No. 97 of 20 June 2008 on ÒPrevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violenceÓ, which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence, stalking and trafficking in human beings, and modified the offence of enslavement. The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation. The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed. The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which deals with issues related to awareness-raising and the promotion of legislative and non-legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens. 

12. On 31 May 2012, a decree was adopted to implement the above-mentioned Law. The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence.  

13. The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino.  

14. In addition, the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women. 


15. The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law, by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers.  

16. The delegation stated that Law No. 142 of 9 September 2014, entitled ÒLegislation relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilitiesÓ, had been approved. That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development of social integration, as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of Education, held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 April 2014, and aimed at protecting students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs.  

17. In the national report, the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability. The proposed framework law fully incorporates the principles, definitions and content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation. The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention. 

18. The delegation stated that, in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption (GRECO), Law No. 141 of 5 September 2014 introduced the ÒCode of Conduct of Public OfficialsÓ. 

19. In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands, the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion. In the light of this, the Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for the implementation of the recommendation. 

20. In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to improve prison detention conditions in San Marino, the delegation stated that procedures had improved in recent years. According to the delegation, San Marino had acceded in December 1989 to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The delegation reported that, since then,  a delegation from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited San Marino four times: in March 1992, June 1999, February 2005 and January 2013. 

21. With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia, on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to 18, the delegation stated that the age of 16 for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations, which San Marino had long planned to change. The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations. 

22. In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media, the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity, integrity and privacy of the individual. The delegation explained that, under that new law, certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions. Moreover, the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for individuals.  


23. The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of newspapers and online publications, by making them equal in all aspects and effects to paper publications, with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of expression.  


 B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
24. During the interactive dialogue, 35 delegations made statements. The recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 

25. Kuwait commended the efforts to promote and protect human rights and welcomed the ratification of a number of international conventions and protocols since 2010, including OP-CRC-SC; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it; and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It noted commendable efforts that San Marino had made for the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities and the accession to related conventions. Kuwait made a recommendation. 

26. Malaysia noted the transparent and consultative approach taken by San Marino with respect to the UPR and the progress made in the field of human rights, through its commitment to implementing the recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the UPR and the introduction of various legislative and institutional measures. In particular, Malaysia commended San Marino for ongoing and continuous steps to protect womenÕs rights and promote the role of women in the country, and measures to further integrate persons with disabilities into society, in line with its obligations under CRPD, amongst others. It noted the adoption of important laws and provisions relating to violence against women and the enforcement of measures for the protection of women, expressed appreciation for the strong belief of San Marino in the value of the family for human development and its efforts to protect the family institution, and encouraged them to continue in that regard. Malaysia made recommendations. 

27. Mexico welcomed the adoption of international instruments since the first cycle of the UPR. In particular, it noted the ratification of OP-CRC-SC, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it. It recognized the advances made in combating domestic violence, notably through the implementation of prevention programmes and the provision of medical and psychological support for victims. It thanked San Marino for the response to its query regarding freedom of expression. Mexico made recommendations. 

28. Monaco welcomed the advances made regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, notably the steps taken to implement CRPD, as well as the extension of the advantages to adoptive and foster parents granted under Law No. 43/2014. Monaco requested further information on the functioning of the residential centre for persons with disabilities. It welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Monaco made a recommendation.  

29. Montenegro commended San Marino for its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, expressing appreciation of its efforts to abolish the death penalty and protect the rights of women and children. While welcoming the dedication of San Marino to the UPR process, Montenegro observed that reports to several committees on the implementation of core human rights instruments were still overdue, and encouraged the Government of San Marino to make additional efforts to improve cooperation with the treaty bodies system. It noted the requests made by the Human Rights Committee concerning the introduction of a juvenile criminal justice system and asked San Marino to elaborate on the activities taken in that regard. Montenegro made recommendations. 


30. The Netherlands commended San Marino on its human rights record and efforts to ratify related instruments. In particular, it welcomed the ratification of the OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC, as well as the accession to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. However, it noted that the independent information and concluding observations of the treaty bodies were out of date, as some country reports were still outstanding. The Netherlands made recommendations. 

31. The Philippines recognized the strong commitment of the Government of San Marino to the overall development of the country and the fulfilment of the human rights of its people and lauded the accession of San Marino to a number of international human rights conventions in the period under review, particularly its ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it. It asked how San Marino, as an advocate of womenÕs rights, could contribute to the strengthening of regional and international cooperation or partnerships in combating trafficking in women and girls. It noted the remarkable progress achieved by San Marino in the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living and the provision of welfare programmes and other social safety nets for citizens who became vulnerable as a result of the recent global financial instability. The Philippines made recommendations. 

32. Portugal praised the commitment of San Marino to the implementation of the recommendations accepted during the first cycle and welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. It noted that, although San Marino had accepted a recommendation during the first cycle of the UPR to improve timely reporting, 10 reports to the treaty bodies were still overdue. It welcomed the creation of a working group to prepare a draft law to adapt San MarinoÕs legal terminology regarding the concepts of legitimate and natural children, and encouraged efforts in that regard. Portugal made recommendations. 

33. Serbia congratulated San Marino for its dedication to human rights, democracy and the rule of law and noted San MarinoÕs efforts to align domestic legislation with international standards, as well as its pledge to comply with international treaties. It applauded San MarinoÕs advocacy work to abolish the death penalty worldwide and commended efforts to implement recommendations made by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It noted that constitutional and legislative norms and ratified international treaties on human rights guaranteed equality and freedom from discrimination, and encouraged San Marino to continue its positive promotion of the principle of equality and non-discrimination, taking into account all relevant recommendations of the European Commission against racism and intolerance. Serbia made a recommendation. 

34. Sierra Leone commended San MarinoÕs efforts to promote and protect human rights in spite of the international economic crisis, which has affected the strategies and measures taken to address the right to a fair trial, as well as the death penalty, violence against women and domestic violence. It was interested to note that San Marino had been the third country to abolish the death penalty. It appreciated efforts to align domestic legislation with international human rights instruments and commended measures to ensure freedom of religion or belief. It acknowledged San MarinoÕs efforts to sign, ratify or accede to more human rights instruments since the first cycle of the UPR, but noted that further efforts were required to address racism, xenophobia and corruption. It lauded San MarinoÕs financial contribution to OHCHR in 2011 and 2013. Sierra Leone made recommendations. 

35. Singapore commended the efforts taken by San Marino to combat domestic violence, noting the role played by the Authority for Equal Opportunities in enforcing the Law on the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women and Gender Violence, implementing the related decree (97) to assist victims of violence and promoting public awareness on services available, including shelter for victims of domestic violence. A technical-institutional panel of experts was set up in 2012 to improve coordination among 


agencies in addressing domestic violence. Singapore noted efforts to build an inclusive society for persons with disabilities, including the drafting of a framework law on disability to strengthen implementation of CRPD, and the preparation of decrees on specific policy themes, such the elimination of architectural barriers, as well as job placements, health and social inclusion. Singapore made recommendations. 

36. Slovenia noted the implementation of the majority of recommendations accepted under the first cycle of the UPR, including ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It noted progress made in the field of anti-discrimination and thanked San Marino for responding to its question on steps taken to improve prison detention conditions. Following the request from the Human Rights Committee, Slovenia requested information on measures that could be taken to modify legislation (article 3 of Act No. 15 of 26 January 1990) regarding the exceptional circumstances in which all citizens aged 16 to 60 could be conscripted. Slovenia made a recommendation. 

37. Spain welcomed the delegation of San Marino and thanked it for its presentation and the replies to its advanced questions. It congratulated the country on the adoption of the Law on Provisions on Maltreatment within the Family and on Children by the Great and General Council. Spain noted the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Committee regarding the failure of San Marino to approve a new Code of Criminal Procedure. Spain made recommendations. 

38. Thailand commended the efforts made by San Marino since its first review, particularly human rights awareness-raising initiatives and the improvement of its normative framework in various areas, aimed at better integration of foreigners and vulnerable groups. It expressed appreciation of progress in the protection of childrenÕs rights, particularly regarding ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It expressed interest in the recent examination of a draft law on provisions against child maltreatment in the family and looked forwards to its adoption. While noting steps already taken to better protect the rights of persons with disabilities, Thailand considered that further efforts could be made to promote independent living and better integration into society. Thailand made recommendations. 

39. Ukraine noted the ratification since the last review of important international human rights mechanisms and the alignment of domestic legislation with relevant international standards. It appreciated the progress made to protect and promote the rights of its citizens, particularly regarding womenÕs rights and gender equality. It recognized the increased representation of women in the San Marino Parliament and encouraged it to take further steps in empowering women to end the underrepresentation of women in the Government, particularly in ministerial positions. Ukraine welcomed efforts regarding freedom of expression, particularly the initiation of procedures on a new draft law on publishing and the profession of media operators, and expressed hope that it would be swiftly adopted and compliant with corresponding international standards. 

40. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed San MarinoÕs firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights.

41. The United States of America commended San MarinoÕs exemplary human rights record, longstanding commitment to democracy and the promotion and protection of human rights.

It noted that the Ministry for Territory and Environment had not 


fully implemented a law that mandated easier access to public buildings for persons with disabilities, and that many buildings remained inaccessible. It made recommendations.  

42. Uruguay noted San MarinoÕs ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and its accession to regional human rights instruments. It noted the draft law to prohibit the corporal punishment of children in all settings, including at home and in day care, and hoped that it would be discussed fruitfully by the Parliament in order to meet San MarinoÕs commitments pursuant to the first cycle of the UPR. It noted San MarinoÕs efforts to comply with its international obligations, in particular regular reporting to treaty bodies. It encouraged San Marino to continue those efforts and its cooperation with OHCHR. It welcomed that San Marino was considering acceding to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). Uruguay made recommendations.  

43. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela emphasized San MarinoÕs political commitment to implementing recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the UPR, despite the serious international economic crisis. It noted San MarinoÕs adherence to international instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. It commended progress made in the legal sphere to promote equality of all people before the law and protect the rights and freedoms of the population and acknowledged the policies to protect womenÕs rights and promote their participation in society through the adoption of important legal provisions and measures relating to the protection of women from violence. It made a recommendation.

45. Argentina welcomed the delegation of San Marino. It congratulated San Marino for acceding to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Argentina made recommendations. 

46. Australia, commending San MarinoÕs exemplary human rights record, noted that its human rights framework valued the integrity of the person, afforded a high degree of political participation and enforced civil liberties. Despite the fact that the Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order prohibited discrimination on all grounds, it was concerned that same-sex couples still encountered discrimination in some basic rights, including residency and inheritance. It commended efforts to protect the rights of persons with disabilities in many areas, particularly employment, education, health care and other state services. Australia made recommendations. 

47. Brazil welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC, OP-CRC-SC and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the enactment of legislation on maltreatment within the family and on children. It maintained that it was important to increase awareness of the importance of combating racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, through the effective implementation of Law No. 66 on provisions against racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. Noting that Decree No. 60/2012 established various forms of assistance to women who were victims of violence, Brazil asked what specific measures had been taken to prevent gender-based and domestic violence. Brazil made recommendations. 


48. Burkina Faso noted San MarinoÕs commitment to cooperate with human rights mechanisms, including its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It welcomed efforts to abolish the death penalty, combat transnational organized crime, legalize the residence status of foreign nationals and support workers who were victims of the economic crisis. It commended the ratification of various human rights instruments, notably OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and regional instruments, by acceding to instruments containing complaint mechanisms and enabling individuals to seek reparation.

It encouraged the establishment of the National Observatory on the Family, increased efforts to promote human rights in its educational system and improved reporting to treaty bodies. 

49. Canada asked San Marino to provide up-to-date information regarding steps to establish an independent ombudsman for the protection and promotion of human rights, in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions (Paris Principles).

Canada made recommendations. 

50. Costa Rica thanked San Marino for the presentation of its national report and congratulated the progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that San Marino had ratified several international instruments and had been the first State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to ratify the amendment to article 8 of that Statute. It welcomed the adoption of measures to prohibit the corporal punishment of children and those that had raised the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Costa Rica made recommendations. 

51. C™te dÕIvoire said that the national report indicated the constant commitment of the Government of San Marino to the promotion and protection of human rights, through the adoption of various measures and policies for the promotion of equality for all, such as those aimed at combating discrimination; protecting women, children, elderly persons and persons with disabilities; combating domestic violence; and strengthening the judicial, political and social systems. Those measures demonstrated the importance that San Marino placed on international obligations and on the protection of fundamental freedoms. It encouraged San Marino to continue to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms. C™te dÕIvoire made recommendations. 

52. Estonia noted San MarinoÕs accession to most core international human rights instruments and its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. However, it raised concern at the lack of reporting to the treaty bodies and hoped that San Marino would make positive steps in that regard. It commended the ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing it, OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. In that regard, it called upon San Marino to review the law on extraordinary military conscription and withdraw the relevant clauses of that law to bring it into compliance with OP-CRC-AC. The protection of womenÕs rights and their participation in society was a priority and should continue. There was a need for a freedom of information law in accordance with international standards. Estonia made recommendations.

55. Ghana welcomed the delegation of San Marino and applauded the countryÕs dedication to the UPR process. Ghana made recommendations. 

56. The Holy See welcomed steps taken since the first cycle of the UPR to promote and protect human rights and strengthen legislation and on the administration of justice in line with international instruments. It commended the continued protection of the institution of the family as a union based on a stable relationship between a man and a woman, and the related legislation that extended the right of a parent to be absent from the workplace when his or her child was ill or to assist family members who required special assistance, including owing to disability or serious age-related disease. It made recommendations. 

57. Indonesia applauded the priority given to the protection of womenÕs rights in national policy and the adoption and effective implementation of Law No. 97/2008 on the prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violence. The establishment of a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles would further support San MarinoÕs efforts to combat violence against women, as well as its efforts in other areas. Indonesia noted that San Marino had ratified several international human rights instruments. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) would be particularly relevant, as one third of San MarinoÕs population lived abroad. Indonesia made recommendations. 

58. Ireland commended San Marino for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. However, it noted that a significant number of reports to the treaty bodies were overdue. It welcomed San MarinoÕs ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Ireland made recommendations. 

59. Italy commended San Marino for its commitment to cooperating with international human rights mechanisms, and for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It noted the difficulties faced by San Marino in fulfilling its reporting obligations, and the measures it had taken to end the backlog. It encouraged San Marino to consider best practices and expedite the drafting of reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It asked for information about the function, lessons learned and best practices of the panel created to coordinate measures to prevent and combat violence against women. It asked whether San Marino would consider the establishment of a formal procedure for processing asylum requests. Italy made a recommendation. 

60. San Marino thanked all the delegations for their interesting and valuable recommendations. 

61. As regards the treatment of asylum applications, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the delegations that it was not foreseen to introduce a relevant procedure, given the very low number of applications received in recent years, often submitted by persons from countries that upheld high human rights standards. Establishing a procedure to determine refugee status would prove problematic owing to the lack of border control between Italy and San Marino. 

62. In the case of foreigners who were unable to return to their home countries, he said that the Government of San Marino may issue an extraordinary stay permit for humanitarian and social protection reasons issued on a case-by-case basis. Beneficiaries 


would then be entitled to temporary medical and financial assistance provided by the Social Welfare Institute. 

63. With respect to questions related to discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and on the need to protect single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that all people were equal before the law and all forms of discrimination were rejected under the Declaration of CitizensÕ Rights. All sectors of the public administration were also abiding by that principle. Such prohibition was reinforced by Law No. 66/2008, which punished anyone who incites or commits any act of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Law considered it an aggravating circumstance. 

64. Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination, he said that San Marino had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise awareness in that field. 

65. The Minister said that great importance had been attached to the role played by the Authority and the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which have jointly promoted actions to encourage the participation of all citizens in the political, social and economic life according to the principle of legal equality. 

66. In that regard, he said that school played a major role. Respect for diversity was discussed and promoted in all school grades, thus favouring integration, learning about different cultures, understanding and tolerance. The fight against discrimination was a practical experience in school, which contributed effectively to inclusion. All children residing in San Marino, including on a temporary basis, were provided with a free education. All children with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, had access to education, including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical tools. 

67. Regarding the question of single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that, in San Marino, there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples. Also, that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law. Indeed, children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in wedlock. In that regard, attention was also brought to single-parent families who, on account of their inherent characteristics, required stronger protection. Due consideration had also been given to single-parent families by allowing single people to adopt children. 

68. The Minister said that a national debate, encouraged by civil society, was ongoing about same-sex unions. Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same-sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households. Cohabitation between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory, but their rights and duties were regulated by private law. 

69. As for human rights education, he said that San Marino was committed to the promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects, including training for teachers and the involvement of families. 

70. He said that education on human rights and the protection and respect for differences followed an interdisciplinary approach and was aimed at promoting the integration of values in all contexts to combat racism and intolerance.  

71. As regards the question on the facility for persons with disabilities, ÒIl Colore del GranoÓ, it was explained that the centre hosted persons with various types of disabilities and contributed to their education, rehabilitation and social inclusion by providing assistance, care and treatment, including in support of their families. 


72. With reference to international instruments, San Marino recognized the importance of treaties that contain individual complaint mechanisms and was committed to addressing reporting delays and to acceding to OP-ICESCR, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, and to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in Education. 

73. The Minister said that, for the time being, San Marino did not intend to adhere to or ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ICRMW, nor the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 

74. As regards the establishment of a national institution on human rights based on the Paris Principles, San Marino considered the existing complaint mechanisms to be adequate. Anyone may file a petition to the Head of State to complain about violations of human rights and other related issues. 

75. On the question about juvenile crime, Law No. 140/2014 raised the age of juvenile jurisdiction to 14, with safeguards for children under 18 and alternative measures to detention under the Criminal Code. 

76. The reform of the Criminal Procedure Code was a major priority. Government Decision No. 20/2013 entrusted a technical working group with the drafting of a new code. 

77. Finally, the Minister committed to giving due consideration to all recommendations to enhance human rights in San Marino.

 A  Presentation by the State under review

6  The delegation noted that  in July 2014  it had presented the national report prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs  Health  Labour and Education and other government offices  It stated that the national report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first review  noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those recommendations   

7  The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order  The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that  in the field of human rights  did not need internal implementation rules  as international law was an integral part of national law  and even superseded this in the event of any conflict   

8  The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted  On 1 July 2010  San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  the Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking 


in Persons  Especially Women and Children  and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land  Sea and Air  supplementing it  On 21 July 2011  it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict  OP CRC AC  and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  OP CRC SC   On 23 October 2013  it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  and  on 5 September 2014  approved Law No  138 on ÒRegulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of GenocideÓ  In recent years  San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments  the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse  the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings  Protocol No  15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the European Charter of Local Self Government  Furthermore  San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No  16 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence  The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments  

9  Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein  the delegation announced that  having ratified on 21 July 2011 the amendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute  on the crime of aggression  was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament   

10  The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol  It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed  though  owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation  the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved  San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession  

11  The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence  through the approval of Law No  97 of 20 June 2008 on ÒPrevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violenceÓ  which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence  stalking and trafficking in human beings  and modified the offence of enslavement  The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation  The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed  The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities  which deals with issues related to awareness raising and the promotion of legislative and non legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens  

12  On 31 May 2012  a decree was adopted to implement the above mentioned Law  The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence   

13  The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino   

14  In addition  the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women  


15  The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law  by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers   

16  The delegation stated that Law No  142 of 9 September 2014  entitled ÒLegislation relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilitiesÓ  had been approved  That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development of social integration  as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of Education  held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 April 2014  and aimed at protecting students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs   

17  In the national report  the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability  The proposed framework law fully incorporates the principles  definitions and content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  CRPD  and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation  The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention  

18  The delegation stated that  in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption  GRECO   Law No  141 of 5 September 2014 introduced the ÒCode of Conduct of Public OfficialsÓ  

19  In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands  the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion  In the light of this  the Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for the implementation of the recommendation  

20  In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to improve prison detention conditions in San Marino  the delegation stated that procedures had improved in recent years  According to the delegation  San Marino had acceded in December 1989 to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  The delegation reported that  since then   a delegation from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited San Marino four times  in March 1992  June 1999  February 2005 and January 2013  

21  With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia  on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to 18  the delegation stated that the age of 16 for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations  which San Marino had long planned to change  The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations  

22  In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media  the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity  integrity and privacy of the individual  The delegation explained that  under that new law  certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions  Moreover  the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for individuals   


23  The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of newspapers and online publications  by making them equal in all aspects and effects to paper publications  with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of expression

64  Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination  he said that San Marino had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise awareness in that field

66  In that regard  he said that school played a major role  Respect for diversity was discussed and promoted in all school grades  thus favouring integration  learning about different cultures  understanding and tolerance  The fight against discrimination was a practical experience in school  which contributed effectively to inclusion  All children residing in San Marino  including on a temporary basis  were provided with a free education  All children with disabilities  including those with severe disabilities  had access to education  including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical tools  

67  Regarding the question of single parent and non conventional families  he said that  in San Marino  there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples  Also  that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law  Indeed  children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in wedlock  In that regard  attention was also brought to single parent families who  on account of their inherent characteristics  required stronger protection  Due consideration had also been given to single parent families by allowing single people to adopt children  

68  The Minister said that a national debate  encouraged by civil society  was ongoing about same sex unions  Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households  Cohabitation between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory  but their rights and duties were regulated by private law  

69  As for human rights education  he said that San Marino was committed to the promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects  including training for teachers and the involvement of families

 I  Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A  Presentation by the State under review 
   The delegation of San Marino presented its report for the second cycle of the UPR on the human rights situation  

   The delegation noted that  in July       it had presented the national report prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs  Health  Labour and Education and other government offices  It stated that the national report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first review  noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those recommendations   

   The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order  The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that  in the field of human rights  did not need internal implementation rules  as international law was an integral part of national law  and even superseded this in the event of any conflict   

   The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted  On   July       San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  the Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking 


in Persons  Especially Women and Children  and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land  Sea and Air  supplementing it  On    July       it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict  OP CRC AC  and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  OP CRC SC   On    October       it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  and  on   September       approved Law No      on ÒRegulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of GenocideÓ  In recent years  San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments  the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse  the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings  Protocol No     amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the European Charter of Local Self Government  Furthermore  San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No     to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence  The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments  

   Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein  the delegation announced that  having ratified on    July      the amendment to article   of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute  on the crime of aggression  was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament   

    The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol  It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed  though  owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation  the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved  San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession  

    The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence  through the approval of Law No     of    June      on ÒPrevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violenceÓ  which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence  stalking and trafficking in human beings  and modified the offence of enslavement  The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation  The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed  The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities  which deals with issues related to awareness raising and the promotion of legislative and non legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens  

    On    May       a decree was adopted to implement the above mentioned Law  The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence   

    The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino   

    In addition  the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women  


    The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law  by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers   

    The delegation stated that Law No      of   September       entitled ÒLegislation relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilitiesÓ  had been approved  That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development of social integration  as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of Education  held in Helsinki on    and    April       and aimed at protecting students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs   

    In the national report  the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability  The proposed framework law fully incorporates the principles  definitions and content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  CRPD  and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation  The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention  

    The delegation stated that  in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption  GRECO   Law No      of   September      introduced the ÒCode of Conduct of Public OfficialsÓ  

    In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands  the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion  In the light of this  the Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for the implementation of the recommendation  

    In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to improve prison detention conditions in San Marino  the delegation stated that procedures had improved in recent years  According to the delegation  San Marino had acceded in December      to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  The delegation reported that  since then   a delegation from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited San Marino four times  in March       June       February      and January       

    With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia  on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to     the delegation stated that the age of    for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations  which San Marino had long planned to change  The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations  

    In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media  the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity  integrity and privacy of the individual  The delegation explained that  under that new law  certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions  Moreover  the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for individuals   


    The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of newspapers and online publications  by making them equal in all aspects and effects to paper publications  with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of expression

    As regards the treatment of asylum applications  the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the delegations that it was not foreseen to introduce a relevant procedure  given the very low number of applications received in recent years  often submitted by persons from countries that upheld high human rights standards  Establishing a procedure to determine refugee status would prove problematic owing to the lack of border control between Italy and San Marino  

    In the case of foreigners who were unable to return to their home countries  he said that the Government of San Marino may issue an extraordinary stay permit for humanitarian and social protection reasons issued on a case by case basis  Beneficiaries 


would then be entitled to temporary medical and financial assistance provided by the Social Welfare Institute  

    With respect to questions related to discrimination  including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity  and on the need to protect single parent and non conventional families  he said that all people were equal before the law and all forms of discrimination were rejected under the Declaration of CitizensÕ Rights  All sectors of the public administration were also abiding by that principle  Such prohibition was reinforced by Law No           which punished anyone who incites or commits any act of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation  The Law considered it an aggravating circumstance  

    Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination  he said that San Marino had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise awareness in that field  

    The Minister said that great importance had been attached to the role played by the Authority and the Commission for Equal Opportunities  which have jointly promoted actions to encourage the participation of all citizens in the political  social and economic life according to the principle of legal equality  

    In that regard  he said that school played a major role  Respect for diversity was discussed and promoted in all school grades  thus favouring integration  learning about different cultures  understanding and tolerance  The fight against discrimination was a practical experience in school  which contributed effectively to inclusion  All children residing in San Marino  including on a temporary basis  were provided with a free education  All children with disabilities  including those with severe disabilities  had access to education  including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical tools  

    Regarding the question of single parent and non conventional families  he said that  in San Marino  there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples  Also  that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law  Indeed  children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in wedlock  In that regard  attention was also brought to single parent families who  on account of their inherent characteristics  required stronger protection  Due consideration had also been given to single parent families by allowing single people to adopt children  

    The Minister said that a national debate  encouraged by civil society  was ongoing about same sex unions  Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households  Cohabitation between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory  but their rights and duties were regulated by private law  

    As for human rights education  he said that San Marino was committed to the promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects  including training for teachers and the involvement of families  

    He said that education on human rights and the protection and respect for differences followed an interdisciplinary approach and was aimed at promoting the integration of values in all contexts to combat racism and intolerance   

    As regards the question on the facility for persons with disabilities  ÒIl Colore del GranoÓ  it was explained that the centre hosted persons with various types of disabilities and contributed to their education  rehabilitation and social inclusion by providing assistance  care and treatment  including in support of their families  


    With reference to international instruments  San Marino recognized the importance of treaties that contain individual complaint mechanisms and was committed to addressing reporting delays and to acceding to OP ICESCR  the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure  and to the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  UNESCO  Convention against Discrimination in Education  

    The Minister said that  for the time being  San Marino did not intend to adhere to or ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  ICPPED   the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  ICRMW  nor the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  

    As regards the establishment of a national institution on human rights based on the Paris Principles  San Marino considered the existing complaint mechanisms to be adequate  Anyone may file a petition to the Head of State to complain about violations of human rights and other related issues  

    On the question about juvenile crime  Law No           raised the age of juvenile jurisdiction to     with safeguards for children under    and alternative measures to detention under the Criminal Code  

    The reform of the Criminal Procedure Code was a major priority  Government Decision No          entrusted a technical working group with the drafting of a new code  

    Finally  the Minister committed to giving due consideration to all recommendations to enhance human rights in San Marino

   The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the Citizens Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order  The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that  in the field of human rights  did not need internal implementation rules  as international law was an integral part of national law  and even superseded this in the event of any conflict   

   The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted  On   July       San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  the Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking 


in Persons  Especially Women and Children  and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land  Sea and Air  supplementing it  On    July       it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict  OP CRC AC  and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  OP CRC SC   On    October       it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  and  on   September       approved Law No      on Regulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  In recent years  San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments  the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse  the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings  Protocol No     amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the European Charter of Local Self Government  Furthermore  San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No     to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence  The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments  

   Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein  the delegation announced that  having ratified on    July      the amendment to article   of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute  on the crime of aggression  was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament   

    The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol  It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed  though  owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation  the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved  San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession  

    The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence  through the approval of Law No     of    June      on Prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violence  which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence  stalking and trafficking in human beings  and modified the offence of enslavement  The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation  The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed  The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities  which deals with issues related to awareness raising and the promotion of legislative and non legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens  

    On    May       a decree was adopted to implement the above mentioned Law  The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence   

    The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino   

    In addition  the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women  


    The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law  by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers   

    The delegation stated that Law No      of   September       entitled Legislation relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilities  had been approved  That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development of social integration  as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of Education  held in Helsinki on    and    April       and aimed at protecting students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs   

    In the national report  the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability  The proposed framework law fully incorporates the principles  definitions and content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  CRPD  and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation  The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention  

    The delegation stated that  in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption  GRECO   Law No      of   September      introduced the Code of Conduct of Public Officials  

    In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands  the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion  In the light of this  the Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for the implementation of the recommendation  

    In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to improve prison detention conditions in San Marino  the delegation stated that procedures had improved in recent years  According to the delegation  San Marino had acceded in December      to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  The delegation reported that  since then   a delegation from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited San Marino four times  in March       June       February      and January       

    With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia  on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to     the delegation stated that the age of    for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations  which San Marino had long planned to change  The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations  

    In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media  the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity  integrity and privacy of the individual  The delegation explained that  under that new law  certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions  Moreover  the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for individuals   


    The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of newspapers and online publications  by making them equal in all aspects and effects to paper publications  with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of expression

    Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination  he said that San Marino had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise awareness in that field  

    The Minister said that great importance had been attached to the role played by the Authority and the Commission for Equal Opportunities  which have jointly promoted actions to encourage the participation of all citizens in the political  social and economic life according to the principle of legal equality  

    In that regard  he said that school played a major role  Respect for diversity was discussed and promoted in all school grades  thus favouring integration  learning about different cultures  understanding and tolerance  The fight against discrimination was a practical experience in school  which contributed effectively to inclusion  All children residing in San Marino  including on a temporary basis  were provided with a free education  All children with disabilities  including those with severe disabilities  had access to education  including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical tools

    The Minister said that a national debate  encouraged by civil society  was ongoing about same sex unions  Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households  Cohabitation between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory  but their rights and duties were regulated by private law  

    As for human rights education  he said that San Marino was committed to the promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects  including training for teachers and the involvement of families  

    He said that education on human rights and the protection and respect for differences followed an interdisciplinary approach and was aimed at promoting the integration of values in all contexts to combat racism and intolerance   

    As regards the question on the facility for persons with disabilities  Il Colore del Grano  it was explained that the centre hosted persons with various types of disabilities and contributed to their education  rehabilitation and social inclusion by providing assistance  care and treatment  including in support of their families  


    With reference to international instruments  San Marino recognized the importance of treaties that contain individual complaint mechanisms and was committed to addressing reporting delays and to acceding to OP ICESCR  the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure  and to the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  UNESCO  Convention against Discrimination in Education  

    The Minister said that  for the time being  San Marino did not intend to adhere to or ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  ICPPED   the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  ICRMW  nor the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  

    As regards the establishment of a national institution on human rights based on the Paris Principles  San Marino considered the existing complaint mechanisms to be adequate  Anyone may file a petition to the Head of State to complain about violations of human rights and other related issues  

    On the question about juvenile crime  Law No           raised the age of juvenile jurisdiction to     with safeguards for children under    and alternative measures to detention under the Criminal Code  

    The reform of the Criminal Procedure Code was a major priority  Government Decision No          entrusted a technical working group with the drafting of a new code

San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed though owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence through the approval of Law No of June on Prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violence which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence stalking and trafficking in human beings and modified the offence of enslavement The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation

Rights of Persons with Disabilities CRPD and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention The delegation stated that in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption GRECO Law No of September introduced the Code of Conduct of Public Officials In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that

submitted by Slovenia on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to the delegation stated that the age of for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations which San Marino had long planned to change The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity integrity and privacy of the individual The delegation explained that under that new law certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions Moreover the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for

he said that in San Marino there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples Also that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law Indeed children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in wedlock In that regard attention was also brought to single parent families who on account of their inherent characteristics required stronger protection Due consideration had also been given to single parent families by allowing single people to adopt children The Minister said that a national debate encouraged by civil society was ongoing about same sex unions Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households Cohabitation between
