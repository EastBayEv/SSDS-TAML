Presentation by the State under review 5. The head of the delegation of Djibouti, the Minister of Justice, said that Djibouti had become a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto in 2010. It had also ratified the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 6. Since 2009, Djibouti had submitted a large number of reports to treaty bodies, including the core document in 2010,1 the report on the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2010,2 the report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,3 the report on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 1 HRI/CORE/DJI/2010. 2 CAT/C/DJI/1. 3 CEDAW/C/DJI/1-3. Rights in 2010,4 and the report on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2012.5 7. A three-pronged cooperation programme had been launched, comprising capacity-building for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and civil society; social mobilization for human rights, targeting both the general public and law enforcement officials such as the judiciary, the police, the gendarmerie and prison guards; and measures to clear the backlog in the submission of reports. 8. In 2010, the Constitution had been revised to abolish capital punishment. The practice of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment was also prohibited by the Constitution. 9. Training courses were conducted for law enforcement officials on the rights and freedoms of persons taken in for questioning or detained, and article 330 of the Criminal Code provided for more severe punishment of officials found guilty of committing acts of torture. 10. Regarding access to justice, recruitment of magistrates had doubled since 2009. In 2012, pursuant to legal aid reform legislation, a service providing counsel at all stages of the proceedings, and a unit for reception and guidance for those involved in proceedings, had been set up. 11. In 2011, the Government had launched the innovative Òmobile courtÓ programme, whereby judges and courts came to communities where none existed. Concerning the communications sector, new regulations governing print and audiovisual media journalists, Act No. 187/AN/07/5 on the Status of Press and Audiovisual Media Staff (March 2007), had been promulgated by the Head of State in May 2007. 12. Djibouti had journalistsÕ trade unions and associations mandated to promote freedom of expression at the national, regional and international levels. They networked with the Federation of African Journalists (FAJ) and the Eastern Africa Journalists Association. 13. The Minister of Communications, responsible for postal and telecommunication services, had implemented a training and information programme on freedom of expression together with the East Africa Regional Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the National Human Rights Commission. 14. Two projects would be launched to set up regulatory bodies, namely a national commission on communications and a national commission responsible for issuing press cards. 15. In the political realm, the Government had recently made important headway through the adoption of an organic Act which partially amended the 1992 Organic Act on Elections. 16. The Ministry of Health had conducted a series of activities to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, including by increasing antenatal and postnatal checkups, which had helped reduce the number of hospital deaths. Antenatal care coverage had increased from 63.60 to 87.27 per cent. Likewise, maternal mortality had fallen from 546 per 100,000 live births in 2002 to 300 per 100,000 live births in 2011. 4 E/C.12/DJI/1-2. 5 CCPR/C/DJI/1. 17. Infant and under-5 mortality rates, which had stood at 67 and 94 per 1,000 live births in 2006, had declined. For 2012, the outcome of the current survey on the subject was awaited. 18. Regional hospitals had been built and others were planned. 19. The number of Ministry of Health staff was increasing steadily, and had risen from 509 in 1999 to 2,353 in 2012. The health budget currently accounted for 14 per cent of the total State budget, health thus representing a significant portion of the national budget. 20. Concerning the right to education, the education policy 2010Ð2019 had made the quality of education a central concern of the 10-year strategy. 21. In the area of governance and sustainable development, Djibouti was currently in the process of redrafting anti-corruption legislation, with the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In connection with that reform, Djibouti was under review and reviewing at the same time. 22. Djibouti was also engaged in comprehensive civil service reform to make it more efficient. 23. Following the statement made by the head of the delegation, the Minister for the Advancement of Women said that Djibouti had a national gender policy for the period 2011Ð2021, which had been enacted as legislation. Its main purpose was to promote equity and gender equality, in accordance with regional and international commitments relating to the economic, social and cultural rights of women. 24. In cooperation with various technical departments such as the department of agriculture and development partners, many families had attended courses in agriculture, poultry farming and fishing, with a special focus on womenÕs role. 25. With regard to the protection of womenÕs physical integrity and the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), at the initiative of the Ministry for the Advancement of Women legislation had been promulgated in 2009 which enabled associations working to combat FGM to bring a claim for damages on behalf of victims unable to lodge a complaint. 26. Advocacy and awareness-raising campaigns in recent years had led to a considerable reduction in FGM among girls and a gradual decline in its most serious form, infibulation, with rates dropping from 98 to 73 per cent. 27. Two key institutional measures had been taken in regard to childrenÕs rights, namely the adoption and implementation of the national policy on comprehensive childhood development in 2008, and the adoption of a National Strategic Action Plan for Children in 2010. 28. When it came to the protection of vulnerable children, a programme launched in 2007 had provided assistance to nearly 1,000 children in the form of school aid, free transport, food for persons living with AIDS and income-generating activities for the parents. 29. Concerning the right to education, the Government ensured respect for the right to education for all, and the Ministry had paid particular attention to the question of equality in education, as shown by measures to reduce gender gaps at school and combat school dropout, especially among girls. Those efforts had borne fruit, with the male/female ratio in primary schools currently standing at 0.98 per cent. 30. With regard to socioeconomic changes, Djibouti had undertaken ambitious programmes and reforms to combat poverty and economic hardship, notwithstanding its arid climate. The countryÕs agricultural potential was being developed by setting up mini.greenhouses and modern irrigation systems, and by installing solar pumps and micro-irrigation kits throughout the country on a trial basis. 31. The fight against poverty was one of the major projects implemented by the Government since 2007, when the National Social Development Initiative was launched. 32. A national solidarity fund of 1 million Djibouti francs, financed exclusively from Government funds, had facilitated the implementation of various activities, including a poverty study and the development of a social safety net strategy based on providing assistance to the population. 33. The implementation of social safety net pilot projects had facilitated the launching of various programmes, including food distribution for vulnerable households during the lean season and the distribution of food coupons. Microfinance development, involving the establishment of savings and loan banks and the launching of youth employment and solar electricity programmes, had also been financed through the solidarity fund. 34. With regard to access to water, 20 new boreholes had been drilled in order to supplement the drinking water supply in the capital. Thirty new boreholes had given more than 100,000 people in rural areas, and their livestock, access to water. In addition, more than 100 cemented wells had been rehabilitated. 35. With regard to the right to housing, the authorities had embarked on turnkey projects for low-cost or social housing. Over 6,000 plots had been cleaned up and almost 2,000 housing units had been built. 36. Under the Millennium Development Goals framework, the authorities were studying options for implementing a comprehensive slum-clearance programme called ÒDjibouti, zero slumsÓ. 37. A bright future was possible if the international community made sure that Djibouti had the means at its disposal to implement all these programmes, which aimed to strengthen the rule of law. B.
