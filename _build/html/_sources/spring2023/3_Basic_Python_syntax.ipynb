      "first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\n",

      "just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\n",

      "languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\n",

      "land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\n",
      "with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\n",
      "road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\n",

      "losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\n",
      "straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\n",
      "hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\n",
      "seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\n",
      "what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\n",
      "time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\n",
      "excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\n",
      "snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\n",
      "the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\n",
      "in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\n",

      "them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\n",
      "deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\n",
      "grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\n",
      "pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\n",
      "the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\n",
      "mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\n",
      "the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\n",
      "we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\n",
      "peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\n",
      "be right before us:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God's seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\n",
      "us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\n",
      "emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\n",
      "sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\n",
      "we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\n",
      "that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\n",
      "and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\n",
      "was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\n",
      "turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\n",
      "devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\n",
      "many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\n",
      "and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\n",
      "shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\n",
      "again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\n",
      "long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\n",
      "road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\n",
      "peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\n",
      "coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\n",
      "staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\n",
      "and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\n",
      "gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\n",
      "ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\n",
      "Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\n",
      "late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\n",
      "that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\n",
      "greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\n",
      "peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\n",
      "grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\n",
      "threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\n",
      "Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\n",
      "hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\n",
      "only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\n",
      "but the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\n",
      "walk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\n",
      "evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\n",
      "approving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\n",
      "before you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\n",
      "pause to light his lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\n",
      "passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\n",
      "though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\n",
      "with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\n",
      "to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\n",
      "patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\n",
      "hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\n",
      "rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\n",
      "stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\n",
      "to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\n",
      "side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\n",
      "by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\n",
      "upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\n",
      "certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\n",
      "faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\n",
      "fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\n",
      "Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\n",
      "Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\n",
      "passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\n",
      "darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\n",
      "happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\n",
      "give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\n",
      "some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\n",
      "the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\n",
      "air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\n",
      "mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\n",
      "into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\n",
      "which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\n",
      "glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\n",
      "was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\n",
      "hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\n",
      "road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\n",
      "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\n",
      "my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\n",
      "the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\n",
      "could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\n",
      "thought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\n",
      "in German worse than my own:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\n",
      "now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\n",
      "the next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\n",
      "snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\n",
      "amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\n",
      "of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\n",
      "us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\n",
      "lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\n",
      "splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\n",
      "beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\n",
      "could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\n",
      "in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\n",

      "\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\n",
      "deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\n",
      "spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\n",
      "very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\n",
      "companions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\n",
      "    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\n",
      "gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\n",
      "putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\n",
      "luggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\n",
      "handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\n",
      "coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\n",
      "hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\n",
      "prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\n",
      "swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\n",
      "from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\n",
      "against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\n",
      "the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\n",
      "on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\n",
      "strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\n",
      "over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\n",
      "excellent German:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\n",
      "care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\n",
      "country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\n",
      "any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\n",
      "little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\n",
      "any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\n",
      "unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\n",
      "then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\n",
      "seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\n",
      "again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\n",
      "so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\n",
      "I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\n",
      "protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\n",
      "delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\n",
      "passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\n",
      "within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\n",
      "suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\n",
      "recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\n",
      "long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\n",
      "another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\n",
      "now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\n",
      "to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\n",
      "it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\n",
      "strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\n",
      "quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\n",
      "sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\n",
      "side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\n",
      "affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\n",
      "jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\n",
      "madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\n",
      "from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\n",
      "the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\n",
      "to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\n",
      "whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\n",
      "doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\n",
      "quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\n",
      "took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\n",
      "time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\n",
      "narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\n",
      "roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\n",
      "rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\n",
      "could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\n",
      "rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\n",
      "It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\n",
      "so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\n",
      "keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\n",
      "fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\n",
      "and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\n",
      "grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\n",
      "however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\n",
      "left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\n",
      "driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\n",
      "jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\n",
      "what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\n",
      "I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\n",
      "his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\n",
      "and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\n",
      "endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\n",
      "Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\n",
      "around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where\n",
      "the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\n",
      "to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\n",
      "formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\n",
      "effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\n",
      "for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\n",
      "as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\n",
      "straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\n",
      "flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\n",
      "wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\n",
      "had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\n",
      "than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\n",
      "for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\n",
      "then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\n",
      "jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\n",
      "around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\n",
      "with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\n",
      "terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\n",
      "For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\n",
      "feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\n",
      "their true import.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\n",
      "some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\n",
      "looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\n",
      "but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\n",
      "had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\n",
      "it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\n",
      "ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\n",
      "calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\n",
      "to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\n",
      "not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\n",
      "looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\n",
      "long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\n",
      "fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\n",
      "the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\n",
      "wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\n",
      "dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\n",
      "seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\n",
      "darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\n",
      "ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\n",
      "always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\n",
      "driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\n",
      "vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\n",
      "and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\n",
      "sky.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\n",
      "awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\n",
      "the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\n",
      "ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\n",
      "it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\n",
      "to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\n",
      "strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\n",
      "crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\n",
      "them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\n",
      "studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\n",
      "massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\n",
      "massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\n",
      "weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\n",
      "reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\n",
      "of the dark openings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\n",
      "or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\n",
      "window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\n",
      "time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\n",
      "me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\n",
      "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\n",
      "customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to\n",
      "explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's\n",
      "clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\n",
      "London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\n",
      "full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\n",
      "I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\n",
      "expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\n",
      "the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\n",
      "in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\n",
      "pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\n",
      "and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\n",
      "wait the coming of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\n",
      "behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\n",
      "light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\n",
      "massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\n",
      "of long disuse, and the great door swung back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\n",
      "moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\n",
      "of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\n",
      "lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\n",
      "throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\n",
      "open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\n",
      "gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\n",
      "motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\n",
      "gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\n",
      "I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\n",
      "holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\n",
      "an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\n",
      "ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\n",
      "happiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\n",
      "that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\n",
      "for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\n",
      "speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\n",
      "the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\n",
      "speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\n",
      "took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\n",
      "protested but he insisted:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\n",
      "available. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\n",
      "my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\n",
      "along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\n",
      "heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\n",
      "to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\n",
      "and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\n",
      "flamed and flared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\n",
      "the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\n",
      "by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\n",
      "through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\n",
      "welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\n",
      "another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\n",
      "fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\n",
      "left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\n",
      "door:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\n",
      "toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\n",
      "into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have\n",
      "dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\n",
      "I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\n",
      "toilet, I went into the other room.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\n",
      "great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\n",
      "his hand to the table, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\n",
      "me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\n",
      "He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\n",
      "it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\n",
      "sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\n",
      "come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\n",
      "whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\n",
      "and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\n",
      "discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\n",
      "be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\n",
      "your instructions in all matters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\n",
      "fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\n",
      "and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\n",
      "my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\n",
      "questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\n",
      "experienced.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn\n",
      "up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\n",
      "at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\n",
      "opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\n",
      "physiognomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\n",
      "thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\n",
      "hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\n",
      "eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\n",
      "hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\n",
      "could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\n",
      "cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\n",
      "the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\n",
      "man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\n",
      "extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\n",
      "though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\n",
      "in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\n",
      "them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\n",
      "coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\n",
      "the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\n",
      "point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\n",
      "repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\n",
      "horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\n",
      "not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\n",
      "grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\n",
      "protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\n",
      "fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\n",
      "window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\n",
      "strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\n",
      "down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes\n",
      "gleamed, and he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\"\n",
      "Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\n",
      "added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\n",
      "hunter.\" Then he rose and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\n",
      "shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\n",
      "so sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me\n",
      "himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\n",
      "\n",
      "I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\n",
      "which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\n",
      "sake of those dear to me!\n",

      "supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\n",

      "extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\n",
      "is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\n",
      "The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\n",
      "my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\n",
      "been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\n",
      "though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\n",
      "but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\n",
      "the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\n",
      "table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\n",
      "could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\n",
      "anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\n",
      "Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\n",
      "breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had\n",
      "it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\n",
      "the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was\n",
      "absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\n",
      "materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\n",
      "library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\n",
      "books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\n",
      "newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\n",
      "and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\n",
      "were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\n",
      "economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\n",
      "and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\n",
      "London Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the\n",
      "Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\n",
      "Law List.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\n",
      "entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\n",
      "night's rest. Then he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\n",
      "will interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of\n",
      "the books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\n",
      "since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\n",
      "of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\n",
      "know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\n",
      "your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\n",
      "humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\n",
      "it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\n",
      "To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed\n",
      "gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\n",
      "fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\n",
      "the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\n",
      "London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\n",
      "enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\n",
      "and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\n",
      "know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\n",
      "like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\n",
      "speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long\n",
      "master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\n",
      "be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\n",
      "Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\n",
      "shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\n",
      "learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\n",
      "error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\n",
      "away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\n",
      "important affairs in hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\n",
      "come into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and\n",
      "added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\n",
      "locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\n",
      "all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\n",
      "my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\" I said I was sure of\n",
      "this, and then he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\n",
      "not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\n",
      "what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\n",
      "what strange things there may be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\n",
      "talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding\n",
      "things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\n",
      "Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\n",
      "pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\n",
      "frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\n",
      "him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\n",
      "instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\n",
      "flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\n",
      "certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\n",
      "are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\n",
      "where treasure has been concealed. \"That treasure has been hidden,\" he\n",
      "went on, \"in the region through which you came last night, there can be\n",
      "but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\n",
      "Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\n",
      "in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\n",
      "patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\n",
      "Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\n",
      "to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\n",
      "their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\n",
      "destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\n",
      "was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\n",
      "sheltered in the friendly soil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\n",
      "there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\"\n",
      "The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\n",
      "sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\n",
      "appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\n",
      "can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\n",
      "would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\n",
      "marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\n",
      "even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\n",
      "find these places again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even\n",
      "to look for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of London and of the house which you\n",
      "have procured for me.\" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\n",
      "own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\n",
      "order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\n",
      "passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\n",
      "lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\n",
      "in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\n",
      "reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I\n",
      "came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\n",
      "went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\n",
      "everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\n",
      "surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\n",
      "subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\n",
      "more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\n",
      "I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\n",
      "fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\n",
      "Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\n",
      "in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\n",
      "other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\n",
      "Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\n",
      "necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\n",
      "Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\n",
      "place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\n",
      "inscribe here:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\n",
      "be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\n",
      "was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\n",
      "built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\n",
      "years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\n",
      "rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\n",
      "Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\n",
      "the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\n",
      "the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\n",
      "make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\n",
      "small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\n",
      "flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\n",
      "periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone\n",
      "immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\n",
      "iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\n",
      "church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\n",
      "to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\n",
      "various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\n",
      "way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\n",
      "be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\n",
      "large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\n",
      "asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had finished, he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\n",
      "live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\n",
      "day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\n",
      "also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\n",
      "not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\n",
      "gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\n",
      "sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\n",
      "and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\n",
      "attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\n",
      "shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\n",
      "battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\n",
      "be alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look\n",
      "did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\n",
      "smile look malignant and saturnine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\n",
      "together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\n",
      "the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\n",
      "England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\n",
      "certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\n",
      "that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\n",
      "estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\n",
      "Yorkshire coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he\n",
      "said; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\n",
      "am informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into\n",
      "the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\n",
      "Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\n",
      "home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\n",
      "After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\n",
      "me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\n",
      "after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\n",
      "say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in\n",
      "every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\n",
      "me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\n",
      "the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\n",
      "They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\n",
      "the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\n",
      "tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\n",
      "can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\n",
      "with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\n",
      "Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\n",
      "long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\n",
      "England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\n",
      "us,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\n",
      "notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\n",
      "warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\n",
      "written of this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\n",
      "diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\n",
      "there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\n",
      "cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\n",
      "never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\n",
      "me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\n",
      "could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\n",
      "and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\n",
      "me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\n",
      "imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\n",
      "at once how I stand--or seem to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\n",
      "not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\n",
      "and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\n",
      "and heard the Count's voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for\n",
      "it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\n",
      "covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\n",
      "but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's\n",
      "salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\n",
      "This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\n",
      "could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\n",
      "the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\n",
      "sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\n",
      "the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\n",
      "feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\n",
      "the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\n",
      "trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\n",
      "round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\n",
      "eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\n",
      "my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\n",
      "held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\n",
      "so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more\n",
      "dangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving\n",
      "glass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the\n",
      "mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!\" and\n",
      "opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\n",
      "out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\n",
      "of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\n",
      "annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\n",
      "the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\n",
      "not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\n",
      "as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\n",
      "peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\n",
      "went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\n",
      "view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\n",
      "of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\n",
      "stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\n",
      "touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\n",
      "tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\n",
      "there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\n",
      "the forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\n",
      "explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\n",
      "bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\n",
      "an available exit.\n",
      "\n",

      "every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\n",

      "that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\n",
      "anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\n",
      "am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\n",
      "one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\n",
      "the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\n",
      "himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\n",

      "doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\n",
      "books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\n",
      "matters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain\n",

      "\n",
      "First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\n",
      "told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\n",
      "wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\n",
      "one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\n",
      "against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\n",
      "ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\n",
      "attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\n",
      "local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\n",
      "solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\n",
      "chance mislead him, so he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\n",
      "the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\n",
      "London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\n",
      "here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\n",
      "sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\n",
      "resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\n",
      "served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\n",
      "have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\n",
      "seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\n",
      "I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\n",
      "Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\n",
      "ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" I answered that\n",
      "certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\n",
      "agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\n",
      "instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\n",
      "himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\n",
      "him without further trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" I replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who\n",
      "do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\n",
      "consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\n",
      "difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\n",
      "against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\n",
      "and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\n",
      "wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\n",
      "foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\n",
      "evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\n",
      "wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\n",
      "spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\n",
      "available, he suddenly stood up and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\n",
      "Hawkins, or to any other?\" It was with some bitterness in my heart that\n",
      "I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\n",
      "sending letters to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my\n",
      "shoulder: \"write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\n",
      "please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\n",
      "employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\n",
      "it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\n",
      "stinted. Is it not so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not\n",
      "mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\n",
      "Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\n",
      "which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\n",
      "could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\n",
      "mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\n",
      "in his own smooth, resistless way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\n",
      "other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\n",
      "friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\n",
      "home to them. Is it not so?\" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\n",
      "note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\n",
      "post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\n",
      "with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\n",
      "as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\n",
      "he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\n",
      "now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\n",
      "to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\n",
      "did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\n",
      "book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\n",
      "some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\n",
      "own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\n",
      "had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\n",
      "were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\n",
      "under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\n",
      "I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\n",
      "Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\n",
      "Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\n",
      "bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\n",
      "about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\n",
      "seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\n",
      "to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\n",
      "hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\n",
      "them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\n",
      "evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\" At the door he\n",
      "turned, and after a moment's pause said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\n",
      "seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\n",
      "chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\n",
      "many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\n",
      "warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\n",
      "haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\n",
      "safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\"--He finished his\n",
      "speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\n",
      "washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\n",
      "dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\n",
      "and mystery which seemed closing around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",

      "_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\n",
      "doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\n",
      "not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\n",
      "my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\n",
      "sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\n",
      "towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\n",
      "inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\n",
      "of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\n",
      "prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\n",
      "the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\n",
      "It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\n",
      "sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\n",
      "terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\n",
      "expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\n",
      "day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\n",
      "in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\n",
      "to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\n",
      "leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\n",
      "below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\n",
      "the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The\n",
      "window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\n",
      "weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\n",
      "the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\n",
      "carefully out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not\n",
      "see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\n",
      "back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\n",
      "so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\n",
      "somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\n",
      "and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\n",
      "repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\n",
      "window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\n",
      "_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\n",
      "first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\n",
      "moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\n",
      "be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\n",
      "stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\n",
      "using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\n",
      "speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\n",
      "semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\n",
      "me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\n",
      "encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\n",

      "_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\n",
      "He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\n",
      "deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\n",
      "had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\n",
      "avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\n",
      "knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\n",
      "explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\n",
      "taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\n",
      "expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\n",
      "stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\n",
      "pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\n",
      "door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's\n",
      "room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\n",
      "escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\n",
      "and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\n",
      "small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\n",
      "them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\n",
      "however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\n",
      "seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\n",
      "and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\n",
      "from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\n",
      "rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\n",
      "again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\n",
      "I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\n",
      "than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\n",
      "see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\n",
      "windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\n",
      "side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\n",
      "was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\n",
      "quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\n",
      "bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\n",
      "impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\n",
      "west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\n",
      "mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\n",
      "mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\n",
      "crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\n",
      "occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\n",
      "comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\n",
      "yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\n",
      "see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\n",
      "all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\n",
      "lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\n",
      "glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\n",
      "which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\n",
      "than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\n",
      "presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\n",
      "found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\n",
      "table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\n",
      "thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\n",
      "diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\n",
      "nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\n",

      "my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\n",
      "dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\n",
      "their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\n",
      "when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\n",
      "no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\n",
      "time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\n",
      "noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\n",
      "almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\n",
      "fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\n",
      "like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\n",
      "in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\n",
      "moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\n",
      "pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\n",
      "about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\n",
      "deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\n",
      "kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\n",
      "day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\n",
      "They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\n",
      "silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\n",
      "come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\n",
      "tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\n",
      "The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\n",
      "on. One said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\n",
      "begin.\" The other added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\" I lay quiet,\n",
      "looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\n",
      "The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\n",
      "of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\n",
      "the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\n",
      "underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\n",
      "the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\n",
      "gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\n",
      "and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\n",
      "like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\n",
      "on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\n",
      "teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\n",
      "my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\n",
      "paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\n",
      "her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\n",
      "skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that\n",
      "is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\n",
      "shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\n",
      "and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\n",
      "I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\n",
      "lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\n",
      "being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\n",
      "saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\n",
      "giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\n",
      "white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\n",
      "passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\n",
      "the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\n",
      "in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\n",
      "face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\n",
      "the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\n",
      "of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\n",
      "from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\n",
      "them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\n",
      "wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\n",
      "cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\n",
      "I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\n",
      "how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me.\" The fair girl,\n",
      "with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" On this the other women\n",
      "joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\n",
      "room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\n",
      "of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\n",
      "and said in a soft whisper:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\n",
      "not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\n",
      "kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\n",
      "to be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh,\n",
      "as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\n",
      "moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\n",
      "nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\n",
      "ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\n",
      "half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\n",
      "horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\n",
      "bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\n",
      "without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\n",
      "moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\n",
      "dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\n",

      "like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\n",
      "clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\n",
      "soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\n",

      "awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\n",
      "and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\n",
      "was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\n",
      "moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\n",
      "beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\n",
      "shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\n",
      "senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\n",
      "becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\n",
      "three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\n",

      "The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\n",
      "seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\n",
      "style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\n",
      "for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\n",
      "anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\n",
      "corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\n",
      "Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\n",
      "though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\n",

      "all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\n",
      "passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\n",
      "minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\n",
      "by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\n",
      "tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\n",
      "odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\n",
      "grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\n",

      "been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\n",
      "steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\n",
      "the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\n",
      "brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\n",
      "any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\n",
      "the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\n",
      "vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\n",
      "my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\n",

      "of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\n",

      "I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\n",
      "something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\n",
      "but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\n",
      "and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\n",
      "and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\n",
      "ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\n",
      "corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\n",
      "burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\n",
      "underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\n",
      "simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\n",
      "repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\n",
      "me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\n",
      "coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\n",
      "horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\n",
      "key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\n",
      "on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\n",
      "was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\n",
      "he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\n",
      "create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\n",
      "helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\n",
      "to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\n",
      "but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\n",
      "cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\n",
      "hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\n",
      "upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\n",
      "paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\n",
      "merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\n",
      "hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\n",
      "caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\n",
      "thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\n",
      "blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\n",
      "own in the nethermost hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\n",
      "on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\n",
      "waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\n",
      "closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\n",
      "cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\n",
      "spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\n",
      "contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's\n",
      "room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\n",
      "With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\n",
      "key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\n",
      "have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\n",
      "the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\n",

      "_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\n",
      "lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\n",
      "which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\n",
      "Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\n",
      "harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\n",
      "view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\n",
      "beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\n",
      "on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\n",
      "see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\n",
      "red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\n",
      "pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\n",
      "Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\n",
      "\"Marmion,\" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\n",
      "ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\n",
      "a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\n",
      "the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\n",
      "graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\n",
      "Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\n",
      "harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\n",
      "stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\n",
      "part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\n",
      "destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\n",
      "out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\n",
      "them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\n",
      "looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\n",
      "sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\n",
      "book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\n",

      "talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\n",
      "stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\n",
      "the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\n",
      "of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\n",
      "and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\n",
      "narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\n",
      "nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\n",
      "banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\n",
      "side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\n",
      "which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\n",
      "it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\n",
      "mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\n",
      "lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\n",
      "is coming this way....\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\n",

      "nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\n",
      "fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\n",
      "person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\n",
      "at the abbey he said very brusquely:--\n",

      "Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in\n",
      "my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,\n",
      "but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\n",

      "bothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\n",
      "fool-talk.\" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\n",
      "things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\n",
      "the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\n",
      "when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--\n",

      "a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\n",
      "the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\n",

      "the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\n",
      "Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\n",
      "with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\n",
      "of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\n",
      "piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\n",
      "joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\n",
      "to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\n",

      "to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\n",
      "it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\n",
      "harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\n",
      "great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\n",
      "visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\n",
      "speed that, in the words of one old salt, \"she must fetch up somewhere,\n",
      "if it was only in hell.\" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\n",
      "any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\n",
      "like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\n",
      "for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\n",
      "booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\n",
      "than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\n",
      "mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\n",
      "breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\n",
      "of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\n",
      "the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\n",
      "swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\n",
      "gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\n",
      "shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\n",
      "corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\n",
      "motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\n",
      "awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\n",
      "found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\n",
      "all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\n",
      "schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\n",
      "that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\n",
      "storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\n",
      "Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\n",
      "the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\n",
      "\"top-hammer\" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\n",
      "the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\n",
      "if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\n",
      "on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\n",
      "hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\n",

      "the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\n",
      "has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\n",
      "intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\n",
      "all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\n",
      "out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\n",
      "side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\n",
      "first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\n",
      "the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\n",
      "light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\n",
      "when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\n",
      "once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\n",
      "curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\n",
      "round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\n",
      "correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\n",
      "When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\n",
      "whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\n",
      "courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\n",
      "to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\n",
      "whilst actually lashed to the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\n",
      "not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\n",
      "by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\n",
      "the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\n",
      "was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\n",
      "the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\n",
      "the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\n",
      "the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\n",
      "was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\n",
      "state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\n",

      "examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\n",
      "pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\n",
      "paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\n",
      "the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\n",
      "teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\n",

      "immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\n",
      "the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\n",
      "whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\n",
      "glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\n",
      "fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\n",
      "Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\n",

      "time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\n",
      "came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\n",
      "gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\n",
      "lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\n",
      "to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\n",
      "close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\n",
      "was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\n",
      "half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and\n",
      "something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\n",
      "and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\n",
      "entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\n",
      "the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\n",
      "view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\n",
      "that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\n",

      "breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\n",
      "collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\n",
      "there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\n",
      "flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\n",

      "and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\n",
      "became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\n",

      "very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\n",

      "occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\n",
      "reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\n",
      "till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\n",
      "to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\n",
      "Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\n",
      "have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\n",
      "unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\n",
      "trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\n",
      "me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\n",
      "passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\n",
      "stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\n",
      "However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\n",
      "was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\n",
      "mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\n",
      "one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\n",

      "Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\n",

      "\"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once\n",
      "that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady\n",
      "that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with\n",
      "her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw\n",
      "her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full\n",
      "opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship\n",
      "makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can\n",
      "bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to\n",
      "draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have\n",
      "done and propose doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,\n",
      "and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew\n",
      "to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no\n",
      "doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.\n",
      "We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we\n",
      "got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\n",
      "amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with\n",
      "me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\n",
      "for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,\n",
      "however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\n",
      "with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her\n",
      "high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\n",
      "make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her\n",
      "that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\n",
      "anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that\n",
      "matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for\n",
      "myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see\n",
      "the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the\n",
      "quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord\n",
      "gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a\n",
      "slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured\n",
      "a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative\n",
      "analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\n",
      "itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite\n",
      "satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\n",
      "cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\n",
      "mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\n",
      "times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\n",
      "regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she\n",
      "used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,\n",
      "and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where\n",
      "Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not\n",
      "returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I\n",
      "have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\n",
      "Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the\n",
      "world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things\n",
      "were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your\n",
      "relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to\n",
      "your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for\n",
      "her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\n",
      "reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\n",
      "wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows\n",
      "what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher\n",
      "and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;\n",
      "and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron\n",
      "nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\n",
      "self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the\n",
      "kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the\n",
      "noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\n",
      "practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I\n",
      "tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in\n",
      "him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra\n",

      "I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\n",
      "shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\n",
      "was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\n",
      "red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\n",
      "her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\n",
      "hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\n",
      "till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\n",
      "seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\n",
      "Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\n",
      "instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\n",
      "the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\n",
      "closed the door. \"My God!\" he said; \"this is dreadful. There is no time\n",
      "to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's\n",
      "action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\n",
      "it you or me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\"\n",

      "I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\n",
      "the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\n",
      "door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\n",
      "an eager whisper:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\n",
      "have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\n",
      "myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\n",
      "sir, for coming.\" When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had\n",
      "been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\n",
      "his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\n",
      "seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\n",
      "him gravely as he held out his hand:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\n",
      "bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.\" For he\n",
      "suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \"You are to\n",
      "help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\n",
      "best help.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can I do?\" asked Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me, and I shall do it. My\n",
      "life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\n",
      "her.\" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\n",
      "knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I do?\" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\n",
      "quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. \"Come!\"\n",
      "he said. \"You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\n",
      "me, better than my friend John.\" Arthur looked bewildered, and the\n",
      "Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\n",
      "or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\n",
      "what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\n",
      "the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\n",
      "the more young and strong than me\"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\n",
      "it hard in silence--\"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\n",
      "old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\n",
      "so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\" Arthur turned to him\n",
      "and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\n",
      "understand----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boy!\" said Van Helsing. \"In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\n",
      "that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\n",
      "shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\n",
      "must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\n",
      "her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\n",
      "Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\n",
      "asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\n",
      "to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\n",
      "them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\n",
      "coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\n",
      "child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.\" She had made\n",
      "the effort with success.\n",
      "\n",
      "It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\n",
      "the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\n",
      "flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\n",
      "its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\n",
      "satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\n",
      "coat. Then he added: \"You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\n",
      "over the table. Friend John, help to me!\" So neither of us looked whilst\n",
      "he bent over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing turning to me, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\n",
      "defibrinate it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\n",
      "operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\n",
      "back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy\n",
      "of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\n",
      "anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\n",
      "was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must\n",
      "have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\n",
      "But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\n",
      "his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\n",
      "heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: \"Do not stir an instant.\n",
      "It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.\" When all was over I\n",
      "could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\n",
      "arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\n",
      "man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\n",
      "presently.\" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\n",
      "pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\n",
      "which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\n",
      "diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\n",
      "and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\n",
      "could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's\n",
      "ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\n",
      "me, saying: \"Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\n",
      "wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\n",
      "much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\n",
      "his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\n",
      "that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\n",
      "the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\n",
      "can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\n",
      "her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\n",
      "have done. Good-bye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\n",
      "but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\n",
      "breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.\n",
      "The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a\n",
      "whisper:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you make of that mark on her throat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you make of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not examined it yet,\" I answered, and then and there proceeded\n",
      "to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\n",
      "punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\n",
      "disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\n",
      "trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\n",
      "was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\n",
      "the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\n",
      "would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\n",
      "have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Van Helsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said I, \"I can make nothing of it.\" The Professor stood up. \"I\n",
      "must go back to Amsterdam to-night,\" he said. \"There are books and\n",
      "things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you\n",
      "must not let your sight pass from her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I have a nurse?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\n",
      "she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all\n",
      "the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\n",
      "possible. And then we may begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May begin?\" I said. \"What on earth do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall see!\" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment\n",
      "later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held\n",
      "up:--\n",
      "\n",

      "off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being\n",
      "from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,\n",
      "and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\n",

      "almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed\n",

      "preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the\n",
      "night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\n",
      "the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\n",
      "gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\n",
      "sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\n",
      "and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\n",
      "and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\n",

      "\n",
      "All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on\n",

      "dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\n",
      "had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\n",
      "possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\n",
      "without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did\n",
      "not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no\n",
      "matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\n",
      "held up a warning finger. \"Do not stir,\" he said, \"but I fear that with\n",
      "growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\n",
      "danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\n",
      "of morphia.\" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\n",
      "intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\n",
      "subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\n",
      "that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\n",
      "cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\n",
      "feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor watched me critically. \"That will do,\" he said. \"Already?\"\n",

      "When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\n",

      "he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\n",
      "myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\n",
      "whispered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\n",

      "rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\n",
      "had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\n",
      "felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\n",
      "what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\n",
      "and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\n",
      "she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\n",
      "show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\n",
      "sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\n",
      "punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\n",
      "edges--tiny though they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\n",
      "strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\n",
      "had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\n",
      "injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\n",
      "voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\n",
      "had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\n",
      "came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\n",
      "said to me gratefully:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\n",
      "must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\n",
      "yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\n",
      "do!\" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\n",
      "for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\n",
      "drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\n",
      "imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\n",
      "lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\n",
      "\"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\n",
      "stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\n",
      "I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\n",
      "reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\n",
      "even the most not-probable. Good-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\n",

      "gentleman.\" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\n",
      "I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that\n",
      "their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\n",
      "similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a\n",

      "you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\n",

      "half-disgust:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\n",

      "and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\n",
      "others if not for your own.\" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\n",
      "well be, he went on more gently: \"Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\n",
      "me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\n",
      "common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\n",
      "wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\n",
      "inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\n",
      "and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\n",

      "I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's\n",
      "actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\n",
      "that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\n",
      "securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\n",
      "the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\n",
      "in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\n",
      "all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\n",
      "the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\n",
      "presently I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\n",
      "this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\n",
      "would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\n",
      "was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\n",

      "much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\n",

      "not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\n",
      "horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\n",
      "a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\n",
      "too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\n",

      "she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen\n",
      "grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\n",
      "was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\n",
      "he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\n",

      "his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\n",
      "and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\n",
      "that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\n",
      "his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \"God! God!\n",
      "God!\" he said. \"What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\n",

      "crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\n",
      "The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\n",
      "aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\n",

      "other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\n",
      "insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\n",
      "second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\n",
      "and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck\n",
      "with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\n",
      "moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\n",

      "over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\n",

      "dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\n",

      "_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\n",
      "Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\n",
      "and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\n",
      "mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\n",
      "finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\n",
      "the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\n",
      "hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\n",
      "more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\n",
      "the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\n",
      "desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\n",
      "tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\n",
      "late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\n",
      "danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\n",
      "and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\n",
      "anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\n",
      "locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\n",
      "rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the\n",
      "gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\n",
      "When he saw me, he gasped out:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\n",
      "not get my telegram?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\n",
      "telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\n",
      "and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\n",
      "raised his hat as he said solemnly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!\" With his usual\n",
      "recuperative energy, he went on: \"Come. If there be no way open to get\n",
      "in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\n",
      "window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\n",
      "handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\n",
      "attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\n",
      "with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\n",
      "opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\n",
      "was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at\n",
      "hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\n",
      "dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\n",
      "servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\n",
      "for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\n",
      "room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\n",
      "each other, and as we moved away he said: \"We can attend to them later.\"\n",
      "Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the\n",
      "door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\n",
      "faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\n",
      "mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\n",
      "sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\n",
      "broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\n",
      "fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\n",
      "drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\n",
      "mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\n",
      "which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\n",
      "Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\n",
      "poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\n",
      "listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\n",
      "it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\n",
      "on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\n",
      "fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\n",
      "but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\n",
      "occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\n",
      "hands. He said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\n",
      "Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\n",
      "get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\n",
      "that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\n",
      "women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\n",
      "affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\n",
      "sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\n",
      "them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\n",
      "them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\n",
      "was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\n",
      "Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\n",
      "as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\n",
      "boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\n",
      "got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\n",
      "we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\n",
      "of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\n",
      "she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\n",
      "with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\n",
      "must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\n",
      "and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\n",
      "earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\n",
      "and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\n",
      "understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\n",
      "away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went\n",
      "on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\n",
      "be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\n",
      "stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's\n",
      "face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\n",
      "a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\n",
      "her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\n",
      "that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\n",
      "still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\n",
      "ever seen her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\n",
      "and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\n",
      "out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the\n",
      "stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\n",
      "closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\n",
      "the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\n",
      "death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\n",
      "observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\n",
      "enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved\n",
      "by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\n",
      "something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\n",
      "another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life\n",
      "won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\n",
      "exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\n",
      "courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\n",
      "veins for her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter with me, anyhow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\n",
      "relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\n",
      "Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\n",
      "glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \"Quincey Morris!\" and\n",
      "rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess Art is the cause.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He handed me a telegram:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\n",
      "Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\n",
      "Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\n",
      "me what to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\n",
      "the eyes as he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\n",
      "trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\n",
      "us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\n",
      "to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\n",
      "told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\n",
      "veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\n",
      "occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\n",
      "and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\n",
      "Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\n",
      "good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\n",
      "whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\n",
      "to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\n",
      "after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\n",
      "breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\n",
      "Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\n",
      "two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\n",
      "thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\n",
      "of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\n",
      "He handed me the paper saying only: \"It dropped from Lucy's breast when\n",
      "we carried her to the bath.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\n",
      "asked him: \"In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\n",
      "mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I\n",
      "did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\n",
      "paper, saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\n",
      "and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\n",
      "is it that you came to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I\n",
      "was all myself again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\n",
      "properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\n",
      "to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\n",
      "had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\n",
      "know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\n",
      "had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\n",
      "fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\n",
      "registrar and go on to the undertaker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\n",
      "sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\n",
      "love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\n",
      "man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\n",
      "more for it! Now go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\n",
      "that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\n",
      "going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\n",
      "where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\n",
      "ourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\n",
      "the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\n",
      "the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\n",
      "as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\n",
      "sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\n",
      "side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\n",
      "expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\n",
      "So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\n",
      "the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\n",
      "rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\n",
      "to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no\n",
      "right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\n",
      "and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't\n",
      "help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong\n",
      "with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\n",
      "that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\n",
      "_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\n",
      "Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\n",
      "must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\n",
      "no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\n",
      "so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so,\" I said, and he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\n",
      "to-day. Is not that so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\n",
      "own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\n",
      "since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\n",
      "all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\n",
      "her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\n",
      "wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\n",
      "bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\n",
      "betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\" As he spoke\n",
      "the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\n",
      "regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\n",
      "mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\n",
      "heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\n",
      "royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\n",
      "answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\n",
      "Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\n",
      "so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\n",
      "in the same phrase: \"That's so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how long has this been going on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About ten days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\n",
      "that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\n",
      "of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it.\" Then,\n",
      "coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \"What took it\n",
      "out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the crux. Van Helsing is simply\n",
      "frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.\n",
      "There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\n",
      "all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\n",
      "not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\" Quincey held\n",
      "out his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the Dutchman will tell me\n",
      "what to do, and I'll do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel\n",
      "in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\n",
      "had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had\n",
      "come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van\n",
      "Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,\n",
      "and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her\n",
      "poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that\n",
      "meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried\n",
      "what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\n",
      "she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\n",
      "a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\n",
      "her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell\n",
      "into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she\n",
      "took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped\n",
      "over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on\n",
      "with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\n",
      "hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\n",
      "the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\n",
      "if in thought, but he said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\n",
      "to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and\n",
      "I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\n",
      "unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\n",
      "that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's\n",
      "strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\n",
      "nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she\n",
      "slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\n",
      "sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\n",
      "haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\n",
      "gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\n",
      "sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\n",
      "changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\n",
      "one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.\n",
      "Quincey went off to meet him at the station.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full\n",
      "and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more\n",
      "colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking\n",
      "with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,\n",
      "the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had\n",
      "grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible\n",

      "had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden\n",
      "boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\n",

      "knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\n",

      "fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\n",
      "were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\n",

      "all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable\n",

      "face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay\n",
      "quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it\n",
      "should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,\n",
      "as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the\n",
      "window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk\n",
      "handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\n",
      "the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\n",
      "her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her\n",
      "teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\n",
      "had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the\n",
      "canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,\n",
      "and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort\n",
      "of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,\n",
      "and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,\n",
      "and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\n",
      "round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now\n",
      "and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,\n",
      "I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\n",
      "flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\n",
      "watching her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.\n",
      "She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with\n",
      "her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto\n",
      "so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she\n",
      "became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was\n",
      "certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\n",
      "stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\n",
      "waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any\n",
      "mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\n",
      "spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen\n",
      "into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face\n",
      "I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\n",
      "sharp whisper: \"Draw up the blind; I want light!\" Then he bent down,\n",
      "and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He\n",
      "removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As\n",
      "he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein\n",
      "Gott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,\n",
      "and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\n",
      "at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark\n",
      "me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and\n",
      "let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but\n",
      "when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\n",
      "he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy\n",
      "was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\n",
      "Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his\n",
      "hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\n",
      "perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\n",
      "shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. \"Come,\" I\n",
      "said, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best\n",
      "and easiest for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\n",
      "his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\n",
      "everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's\n",
      "hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we\n",
      "came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\n",
      "softly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!\" He was stooping to\n",
      "kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \"No,\" he whispered, \"not\n",
      "yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\n",
      "with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then\n",
      "gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her\n",
      "breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\n",
      "the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\n",
      "gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a\n",
      "sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\n",
      "were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,\n",
      "such as I had never heard from her lips:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\" Arthur bent\n",
      "eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\n",
      "had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\n",
      "the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\n",
      "I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\n",
      "across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not for your life!\" he said; \"not for your living soul and hers!\" And\n",
      "he stood between them like a lion at bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\n",
      "or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\n",
      "the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as\n",
      "of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\n",
      "together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\n",
      "putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown\n",
      "one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. \"My true friend,\" she said, in a\n",
      "faint voice, but with untellable pathos, \"My true friend, and his! Oh,\n",
      "guard him, and give me peace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I swear it!\" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\n",
      "hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said\n",
      "to him: \"Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\n",
      "forehead, and only once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\n",

      "\n",
      "And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\n",
      "ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all over,\" said Van Helsing. \"She is dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he\n",
      "sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\n",
      "nearly broke me down to see.\n",
      "\n",

      "Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\n",
      "recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\n",

      "The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\n",
      "her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\n",
      "formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\n",
      "afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\n",
      "Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\n",
      "me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\n",
      "from the death-chamber:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to\n",

      "\n",
      "I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\n",
      "the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\n",
      "at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\n",
      "father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\n",
      "bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\n",
      "ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's\n",
      "papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\n",
      "foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\n",
      "so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\n",
      "this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\n",
      "coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\n",
      "as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\n",
      "Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\n",
      "here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself\n",
      "search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\n",
      "the hands of strangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\n",
      "the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to\n",
      "him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions\n",
      "regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\n",
      "letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\n",
      "saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked, to which he replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\n",
      "have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\n",
      "diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\n",
      "nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\n",
      "his sanction, I shall use some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\n",

      "for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\n",
      "certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\n",
      "_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\n",
      "and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\n",
      "winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\n",
      "turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\n",
      "wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's\n",
      "loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\n",
      "instead of leaving traces of \"decay's effacing fingers,\" had but\n",
      "restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\n",
      "that I was looking at a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\n",
      "there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \"Remain till I\n",
      "return,\" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\n",
      "from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\n",
      "placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\n",
      "took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\n",
      "placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\n",
      "came away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\n",
      "door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\n",
      "knives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\n",
      "now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\n",
      "her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\n",
      "no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\n",
      "the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\n",
      "you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\n",
      "operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\n",
      "Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,\n",
      "and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\n",
      "ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\n",
      "unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\n",
      "all, so that none know, save we alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\n",
      "without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\n",
      "to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\n",
      "knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\n",
      "tenderness:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\n",
      "because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\n",
      "that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\n",
      "shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\n",
      "things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\n",
      "did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but\n",
      "man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you\n",
      "send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay\n",
      "horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\n",
      "dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw\n",
      "how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\n",
      "weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not\n",
      "hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many\n",
      "years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\n",
      "strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend\n",
      "John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\n",
      "not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\n",
      "trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,\n",
      "oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\" He paused a\n",
      "moment and went on solemnly: \"Friend John, there are strange and\n",
      "terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\n",
      "a good end. Will you not have faith in me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,\n",
      "and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without\n",
      "moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\n",
      "her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\n",
      "lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\n",
      "to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl\n",
      "putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\n",
      "alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\n",
      "might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\n",

      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",

      "I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\n",
      "Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\n",
      "impressed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" he said sternly, \"it is too late--or too early. See!\" Here he\n",
      "held up the little golden crucifix. \"This was stolen in the night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How, stolen,\" I asked in wonder, \"since you have it now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\n",
      "woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely\n",
      "come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus\n",
      "unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\n",
      "new puzzle to grapple with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.\n",
      "Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial\n",
      "and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\n",
      "cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for\n",
      "some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\n",
      "in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\n",
      "entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct\n",
      "issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\n",
      "real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had\n",
      "told us so much he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\n",
      "pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\n",
      "penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\n",
      "alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\n",
      "collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out\n",
      "her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were\n",
      "right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should\n",
      "have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.\n",
      "Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\n",
      "disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\n",
      "wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come\n",
      "into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her\n",
      "mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\n",
      "will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been\n",
      "treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,\n",
      "though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the\n",
      "inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just\n",
      "rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure\n",
      "you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\n",
      "he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an\n",
      "object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\n",
      "see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to\n",
      "us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\n",
      "criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so\n",
      "a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in\n",
      "very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,\n",
      "true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and\n",
      "there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at\n",
      "once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\n",
      "explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\n",
      "less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_\n",
      "quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and\n",
      "exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\n",
      "the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\n",
      "as we could avoid were saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\n",
      "manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\n",
      "much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\n",
      "attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\n",
      "bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\n",
      "was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\n",
      "constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\n",
      "bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I\n",
      "felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and\n",
      "led me in, saying huskily:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\n",
      "no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to\n",
      "thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\n",
      "laid his head on my breast, crying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me\n",
      "all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much\n",
      "expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\n",
      "shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's\n",
      "heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\n",
      "softly to him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come and look at her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.\n",
      "God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\n",
      "loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\n",
      "fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At\n",
      "last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jack, is she really dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\n",
      "that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than\n",
      "I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\n",
      "softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\n",
      "especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\n",
      "suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\n",
      "kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\n",
      "long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\n",
      "coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his\n",
      "and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,\n",
      "fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\n",
      "good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men\n",
      "to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he\n",
      "came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he\n",
      "replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\n",
      "the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but\n",
      "when we had lit our cigars he said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord----\"; but Arthur interrupted him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:\n",
      "I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\n",
      "recent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor answered very sweetly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you\n",
      "'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\n",
      "Arthur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Call me what you will,\" he said. \"I hope I may always have the title of\n",
      "a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\n",
      "your goodness to my poor dear.\" He paused a moment, and went on: \"I know\n",
      "that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\n",
      "rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember\"--the\n",
      "Professor nodded--\"you must forgive me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered with a grave kindness:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\n",
      "violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\n",
      "cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be\n",
      "more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\n",
      "not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust\n",
      "shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\n",
      "though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from\n",
      "first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her\n",
      "dear sake to whom I swore to protect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And, indeed, indeed, sir,\" said Arthur warmly, \"I shall in all ways\n",
      "trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\n",
      "Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\n",
      "speak, and finally said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I ask you something now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, poor dear; I never thought of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I\n",
      "want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and\n",
      "letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,\n",

      "\"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\n",

      "experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\n",

      "Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not\n",

      "and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not\n",

      "\"The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock\n",
      "to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;\n",
      "at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet\n",
      "very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,\n",
      "I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child\n",

      "say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\n",
      "in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he\n",
      "will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\n",
      "wish to learn. And then----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then?\" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we\n",
      "spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is\n",
      "the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to\n",
      "Arthur.\" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful\n",
      "ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what\n",
      "heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\n",
      "passing....\n",
      "\n",
      "We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\n",
      "altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\n",
      "throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the\n",
      "similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,\n",
      "and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he\n",
      "attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some\n",
      "animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think\n",
      "that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern\n",
      "heights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there may\n",
      "be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some\n",

      "the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred\n",
      "there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago\n",
      "a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a\n",
      "week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the\n",
      "Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare\n",
      "came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even\n",

      "started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\n",
      "made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\n",
      "radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he\n",
      "went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to\n",
      "locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at\n",
      "last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse\n",
      "police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of\n",
      "the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for\n",
      "it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found\n",
      "the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,\n",
      "and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to\n",
      "precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the\n",
      "courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My\n",
      "companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\n",
      "carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,\n",
      "one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he\n",
      "fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,\n",
      "proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed\n",
      "with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some\n",
      "days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\n",
      "turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\n",
      "beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\n",
      "stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\n",
      "brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\n",
      "candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\n",
      "imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\n",
      "not the only thing which could pass away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so\n",
      "that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\n",
      "dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\n",
      "made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took\n",
      "out a turnscrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\" Straightway he began\n",
      "taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\n",
      "casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed\n",
      "to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\n",
      "stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\n",
      "hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: \"You shall see,\" and again\n",
      "fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew\n",
      "through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\n",
      "made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of\n",
      "the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We\n",
      "doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\n",
      "such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never\n",
      "stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of\n",
      "the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the\n",
      "edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\n",
      "coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\n",
      "Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\n",
      "and so emboldened to proceed in his task. \"Are you satisfied now, friend\n",
      "John?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\n",
      "I answered him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only\n",
      "proves one thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is that, friend John?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That it is not there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is good logic,\" he said, \"so far as it goes. But how do you--how\n",
      "can you--account for it not being there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps a body-snatcher,\" I suggested. \"Some of the undertaker's people\n",
      "may have stolen it.\" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\n",
      "the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. \"Ah\n",
      "well!\" he said, \"we must have more proof. Come with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\n",
      "them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\n",
      "bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and\n",
      "locked it. He handed me the key, saying: \"Will you keep it? You had\n",
      "better be assured.\" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\n",
      "bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. \"A key is nothing,\" I said;\n",
      "\"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\n",
      "of that kind.\" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he\n",
      "told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at\n",
      "the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\n",
      "figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\n",
      "clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and\n",
      "unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\n",
      "and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\n",
      "observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had\n",
      "a dreary, miserable time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\n",
      "streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\n",
      "farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\n",
      "Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I\n",
      "too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I\n",
      "stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an\n",
      "early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\n",
      "juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\n",
      "figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden\n",
      "by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the\n",
      "rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\n",
      "coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When\n",
      "he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not see the child?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\" I\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall see,\" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\n",
      "out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\n",
      "trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was\n",
      "without a scratch or scar of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was I right?\" I asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were just in time,\" said the Professor thankfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\n",
      "about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\n",
      "give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\n",
      "have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.\n",
      "So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\n",
      "heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\n",
      "it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out\n",
      "well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy\n",
      "tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until\n",
      "he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation\n",
      "of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a\n",
      "cab near the \"Spaniards,\" and drove to town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'\n",

      "_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable\n",
      "opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,\n",
      "and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\n",
      "away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw\n",
      "the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till\n",
      "morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not\n",
      "want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the\n",
      "reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of\n",
      "place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were\n",
      "incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.\n",
      "Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead\n",
      "nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to\n",
      "open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\n",
      "eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,\n",
      "and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\n",
      "no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again\n",
      "courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as\n",
      "last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\n",
      "streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.\n",
      "He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\n",
      "of surprise and dismay shot through me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\n",
      "funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\n",
      "could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than\n",
      "before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this a juggle?\" I said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you convinced now?\" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\n",
      "he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\n",
      "dead lips and showed the white teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See,\" he went on, \"see, they are even sharper than before. With this\n",
      "and this\"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\n",
      "it--\"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend\n",
      "John?\" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not\n",
      "accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\n",
      "argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She may have been placed here since last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know. Some one has done it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not\n",
      "look so.\" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not\n",
      "seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\n",
      "triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\n",
      "the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\n",
      "examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is\n",
      "some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire\n",
      "when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\n",
      "that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\n",
      "he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she\n",
      "is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when\n",
      "the Un-Dead sleep at home\"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\n",
      "his arm to designate what to a vampire was \"home\"--\"their face show what\n",
      "they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\n",
      "the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so\n",
      "it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\" This turned my blood\n",
      "cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's\n",
      "theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\n",
      "idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\n",
      "my face, for he said almost joyously:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, you believe now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I answered: \"Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to\n",
      "accept. How will you do this bloody work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\n",
      "drive a stake through her body.\" It made me shudder to think of so\n",
      "mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling\n",
      "was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to\n",
      "shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\n",
      "called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,\n",
      "or all objective?\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\n",
      "if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\n",
      "snap, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I\n",
      "did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is\n",
      "to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are\n",
      "thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is\n",
      "simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\n",
      "now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to\n",
      "want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the\n",
      "wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at\n",
      "the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\n",
      "to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\n",
      "beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know\n",
      "of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\n",
      "and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\n",
      "Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I\n",
      "took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me\n",
      "because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\n",
      "good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\n",
      "this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\n",
      "killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\n",
      "have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet\n",
      "he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will\n",
      "sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\n",
      "his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he\n",
      "will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\n",
      "an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since\n",
      "I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\n",
      "must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,\n",
      "must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\n",
      "him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is\n",
      "made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see\n",
      "that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\n",
      "churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the\n",
      "Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,\n",
      "and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we\n",

      "Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he\n",
      "wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all\n",
      "our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would\n",
      "all come with him too, \"for,\" he said, \"there is a grave duty to be done\n",
      "there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\" This query was\n",
      "directly addressed to Lord Godalming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble\n",
      "around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been\n",
      "curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the\n",
      "more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself\n",
      "that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me too,\" said Quincey Morris laconically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the Professor, \"then you are nearer the beginning, both of\n",
      "you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can\n",
      "even get so far as to begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of\n",
      "mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said\n",
      "with intense gravity:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I\n",
      "know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will\n",
      "know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me\n",
      "in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a\n",
      "time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may\n",
      "be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's frank anyhow,\" broke in Quincey. \"I'll answer for the Professor.\n",
      "I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good\n",
      "enough for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you, sir,\" said Van Helsing proudly. \"I have done myself the\n",
      "honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear\n",
      "to me.\" He held out a hand, which Quincey took.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Arthur spoke out:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they\n",
      "say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman\n",
      "or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.\n",
      "If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of\n",
      "these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I\n",
      "cannot understand what you are driving at.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I accept your limitation,\" said Van Helsing, \"and all I ask of you is\n",
      "that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first\n",
      "consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\n",
      "reservations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agreed!\" said Arthur; \"that is only fair. And now that the\n",
      "_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at\n",
      "Kingstead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where poor Lucy is buried?\" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: \"And\n",
      "when there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To enter the tomb!\" Arthur stood up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,\n",
      "I see that you are in earnest.\" He sat down again, but I could see that\n",
      "he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was\n",
      "silence until he asked again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when in the tomb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To open the coffin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is too much!\" he said, angrily rising again. \"I am willing to be\n",
      "patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration\n",
      "of the grave--of one who----\" He fairly choked with indignation. The\n",
      "Professor looked pityingly at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I\n",
      "would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and\n",
      "for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care, sir, take care!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?\" said Van Helsing.\n",
      "\"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go\n",
      "on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's fair enough,\" broke in Morris.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to\n",
      "her. But if she be not dead----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur jumped to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" he cried. \"What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has\n",
      "she been buried alive?\" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could\n",
      "soften.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no\n",
      "further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what\n",
      "is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they\n",
      "may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But\n",
      "I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heavens and earth, no!\" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \"Not for\n",
      "the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.\n",
      "Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should\n",
      "torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to\n",
      "cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or\n",
      "am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a\n",
      "desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a\n",
      "duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do\n",
      "it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\n",
      "said, gravely and sternly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty\n",
      "to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you\n",
      "now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when\n",
      "later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its\n",
      "fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it\n",
      "may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall\n",
      "hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\n",
      "you will.\" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of\n",
      "pity:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of\n",
      "acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\n",
      "my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if\n",
      "the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from\n",
      "you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can\n",
      "to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so\n",
      "much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land\n",
      "to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and\n",
      "then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I\n",
      "am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you\n",
      "gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her\n",
      "lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights\n",
      "and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good\n",
      "even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\" He\n",
      "said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected\n",
      "by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\n",
      "shall go with you and wait.\"\n",

      "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the\n",
      "churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams\n",
      "of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across\n",
      "the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly\n",
      "in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked\n",
      "well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so\n",
      "sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it\n",
      "that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant\n",
      "to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural\n",
      "hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by\n",
      "entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.\n",
      "He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped\n",
      "forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\n",
      "coffin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was.\" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.\" He\n",
      "took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur\n",
      "looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\n",
      "forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\n",
      "at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,\n",
      "the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\n",
      "again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.\n",
      "Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\n",
      "recoiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffin was empty!\n",
      "\n",
      "For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by\n",
      "Quincey Morris:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask\n",
      "such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a\n",
      "doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.\n",
      "Is this your doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\n",
      "touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\n",
      "I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which\n",
      "was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and\n",
      "saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in\n",
      "day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,\n",
      "and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came\n",
      "here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here\n",
      "all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable\n",
      "that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\n",
      "which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last\n",
      "night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my\n",
      "garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But\n",
      "bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me\n",
      "outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.\n",
      "So\"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--\"now to the outside.\"\n",
      "He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\n",
      "door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\n",
      "that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing\n",
      "gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\n",
      "passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was\n",
      "to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how\n",
      "humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to\n",
      "hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each\n",
      "in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I\n",
      "could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the\n",
      "mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to\n",
      "throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey\n",
      "Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\n",
      "accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to\n",
      "stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of\n",
      "tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\n",
      "definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\n",
      "thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\n",
      "napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\n",
      "dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\n",
      "mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin\n",
      "strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\n",
      "setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\n",
      "asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near\n",
      "also, as they too were curious. He answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\" asked Quincey.\n",
      "\"Great Scott! Is this a game?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that which you are using?\" This time the question was by\n",
      "Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.\" It was an\n",
      "answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\n",
      "that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a\n",
      "purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was\n",
      "impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places\n",
      "assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\n",
      "one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself\n",
      "been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,\n",
      "who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\n",
      "within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or\n",
      "yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree\n",
      "or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\n",
      "mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\n",
      "woeful presage through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the\n",
      "Professor a keen \"S-s-s-s!\" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews\n",
      "we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something\n",
      "dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of\n",
      "moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling\n",
      "prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.\n",
      "We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a\n",
      "fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a\n",
      "child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We\n",
      "were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as\n",
      "he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the\n",
      "white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see\n",
      "clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,\n",
      "and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of\n",
      "Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was\n",
      "turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\n",
      "wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\n",
      "all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the\n",
      "tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\n",
      "concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips\n",
      "were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\n",
      "chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even\n",
      "Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had\n",
      "not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\n",
      "shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\n",
      "when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form\n",
      "and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\n",
      "the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love\n",
      "passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\n",
      "done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\n",
      "light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,\n",
      "how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to\n",
      "the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\n",
      "clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\n",
      "over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There\n",
      "was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\n",
      "she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell\n",
      "back and hid his face in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are\n",
      "hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\n",
      "tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\n",
      "who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under\n",
      "a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She\n",
      "was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\n",
      "them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a\n",
      "suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\n",
      "the tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\n",
      "arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was\n",
      "shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no\n",
      "quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled\n",
      "malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\n",
      "mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw\n",
      "out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of\n",
      "the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,\n",
      "blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\n",
      "the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could\n",
      "kill--we saw it at that moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\n",
      "between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\n",
      "entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\n",
      "answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like\n",
      "this ever any more;\" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I\n",
      "simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the\n",
      "click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close\n",
      "to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred\n",
      "emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified\n",
      "amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\n",
      "body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\n",
      "where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of\n",
      "relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\n",
      "to the edges of the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was done, he lifted the child and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a\n",
      "funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The\n",
      "friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\n",
      "the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of\n",
      "to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\n",
      "night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find\n",
      "him, as on the other night; and then to home.\" Coming close to Arthur,\n",
      "he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look\n",
      "back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter\n",
      "waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have\n",
      "passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\n",
      "overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\n",
      "on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\n",
      "slept with more or less reality of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,\n",
      "Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to\n",
      "notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of\n",
      "course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\n",
      "us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\n",
      "strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\n",
      "gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief\n",
      "that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\n",
      "ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\n",
      "long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\n",
      "fair weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\n",
      "the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\n",
      "Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it\n",
      "behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also\n",
      "two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own\n",
      "ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work\n",
      "by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur\n",
      "trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its\n",
      "death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but\n",
      "loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her\n",
      "soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently\n",
      "he said to Van Helsing:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her\n",
      "as she was, and is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,\n",
      "the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to\n",
      "see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a\n",
      "devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual\n",
      "methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\n",
      "placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some\n",
      "plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\n",
      "a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue\n",
      "flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a\n",
      "round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about\n",
      "three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and\n",
      "was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\n",
      "as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To\n",
      "me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\n",
      "bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\n",
      "to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their\n",
      "courage, and remained silent and quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\n",
      "experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\n",
      "of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the\n",
      "curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age\n",
      "adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that\n",
      "die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey\n",
      "on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the\n",
      "ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met\n",
      "that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night\n",
      "when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,\n",
      "have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would\n",
      "all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.\n",
      "The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those\n",
      "children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if\n",
      "she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her\n",
      "power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that\n",
      "so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny\n",
      "wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays\n",
      "unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when\n",
      "this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor\n",
      "lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by\n",
      "night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she\n",
      "shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will\n",
      "be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.\n",
      "To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\n",
      "right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\n",
      "night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\n",
      "was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\n",
      "herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be\n",
      "such a one amongst us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\n",
      "kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\n",
      "Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\n",
      "said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\n",
      "snow:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me\n",
      "what I am to do, and I shall not falter!\" Van Helsing laid a hand on his\n",
      "shoulder, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be\n",
      "driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\n",
      "that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\n",
      "than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\n",
      "you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only\n",
      "think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\n",
      "you all the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me what I am to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\n",
      "heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for\n",
      "the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\n",
      "follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that\n",
      "we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\n",
      "action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened\n",
      "his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\n",
      "could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\n",
      "see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\n",
      "came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted\n",
      "in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\n",
      "lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur\n",
      "never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\n",
      "rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\n",
      "the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His\n",
      "face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\n",
      "gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\n",
      "vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\n",
      "teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The\n",
      "terrible task was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had\n",
      "we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,\n",
      "and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain\n",
      "on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\n",
      "considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few\n",
      "minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\n",
      "coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\n",
      "to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\n",
      "been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\n",
      "strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\n",
      "horror that lay upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\n",
      "and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\n",
      "privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\n",
      "her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that\n",
      "there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\n",
      "pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\n",
      "to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\n",
      "sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\n",
      "symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to\n",
      "him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand\n",
      "in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\n",
      "and me peace.\" He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying\n",
      "his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\n",
      "unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\n",
      "she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning\n",
      "devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is\n",
      "the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\n",
      "tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\n",
      "of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\n",
      "garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,\n",
      "and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked\n",
      "the door he gave the key to Arthur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\n",
      "seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was\n",
      "gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\n",
      "on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\n",
      "to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\n",
      "of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can\n",
      "follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in\n",
      "it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all\n",
      "of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do\n",
      "we not promise to go on to the bitter end?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the\n",
      "Professor as we moved off:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of\n",
      "the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you\n",
      "know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans\n",
      "unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult\n",
      "about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall\n",
      "return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I\n",
      "shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.\n",
      "Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a\n",
      "terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we\n",
      "must not draw back.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram\n",

      "     \"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA\n",
      "     HARKER.\"\n",

      "\"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your\n",
      "house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en\n",
      "route_, so that she may be prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of\n",
      "a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten\n",
      "copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. \"Take these,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of\n",
      "all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep\n",
      "them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your\n",
      "faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What\n",
      "is here told,\" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of\n",
      "papers as he spoke, \"may be the beginning of the end to you and me and\n",
      "many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the\n",
      "earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in\n",
      "any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have\n",
      "kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we\n",
      "shall go through all these together when we meet.\" He then made ready\n",
      "for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I\n",
      "took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before\n",
      "the train came in.\n",

      "after a quick glance, said: \"Dr. Seward, is it not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you are Mrs. Harker!\" I answered at once; whereupon she held out\n",
      "her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----\" She stopped\n",
      "suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it\n",
      "was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a\n",
      "typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had\n",
      "sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom\n",
      "prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.\n",
      "\n",
      "In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a\n",

      "\n",
      "She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as\n",
      "she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph\n",
      "diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at\n",
      "the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before\n",
      "me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an\n",

      "the door, and on his calling out, \"Come in,\" I entered.\n",

      "\"Why not?\" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.\n",

      "could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband\n",
      "and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.\n",
      "I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got\n",
      "his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded, and he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and\n",
      "kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all\n",
      "I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have\n",
      "had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble\n",
      "to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--\"\n",
      "Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear\n",
      "the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid\n",
      "a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the\n",
      "room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man\n",
      "free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or\n",
      "emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when\n",
      "Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and\n",
      "gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I\n",
      "hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it\n",
      "afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I\n",
      "_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I\n",
      "could see that his heart was breaking:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\n",
      "her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let\n",
      "me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have\n",
      "had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can\n",
      "help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for\n",
      "Lucy's sake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed\n",
      "to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\n",
      "vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\n",
      "his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat\n",
      "down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite\n",
      "pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his\n",
      "head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with\n",
      "emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\n",
      "smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big\n",
      "sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby\n",
      "that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\n",
      "were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\n",
      "apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for\n",
      "days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been\n",
      "unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\n",
      "sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\n",
      "whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was\n",
      "surrounded, he could speak freely. \"I know now how I suffered,\" he said,\n",
      "as he dried his eyes, \"but I do not know even yet--and none other can\n",
      "ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall\n",
      "know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful\n",
      "now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be\n",
      "like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For dear Lucy's sake,\" I said as we clasped hands. \"Ay, and for your\n",
      "own sake,\" he added, \"for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth\n",
      "the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring\n",
      "to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call\n",
      "in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\n",
      "sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\n",
      "will let me know.\" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\n",
      "I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\n",
      "He turned as he heard my footsteps. \"How is Art?\" he said. Then noticing\n",
      "my red eyes, he went on: \"Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor\n",
      "old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in\n",
      "trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the\n",
      "manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\n",
      "how much I knew; so I said to him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me\n",
      "be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You\n",
      "will know, later on, why I speak.\" He saw that I was in earnest, and\n",
      "stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed\n",
      "but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\n",
      "bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\n",
      "momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\n",
      "as ever you live!\" Then he went into the study to his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little girl!\"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he\n",
      "proved himself a friend!\n",

      "\n",
      "_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming\n",
      "and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript\n",
      "of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife\n",
      "had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the\n",
      "carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave\n",
      "us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I\n",
      "have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had\n",
      "finished, Mrs. Harker said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.\n",
      "Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary\n",
      "interests me so much!\" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I\n",
      "could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so\n",
      "I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a\n",
      "lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\" I\n",
      "answered. \"Oh, very well,\" he said; \"let her come in, by all means; but\n",
      "just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\" His method of tidying was\n",
      "peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\n",
      "before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was\n",
      "jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting\n",
      "task, he said cheerfully: \"Let the lady come in,\" and sat down on the\n",
      "edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\n",
      "he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might\n",
      "have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\n",
      "before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I\n",
      "could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She\n",
      "came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\n",
      "the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\n",
      "people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and\n",
      "held out her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,\" said she. \"You see, I know you, for Dr.\n",
      "Seward has told me of you.\" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all\n",
      "over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one\n",
      "of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,\n",
      "you know, for she's dead.\" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever\n",
      "saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what are you doing here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then don't stay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why not?\" I thought that this style of conversation might not be\n",
      "pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?\" His reply was simply\n",
      "contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.\n",
      "Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an asinine question!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\" said Mrs. Harker, at once\n",
      "championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as\n",
      "he had shown contempt to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so\n",
      "loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of\n",
      "interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his\n",
      "household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of\n",
      "them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and\n",
      "effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I\n",
      "cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates\n",
      "lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.\" I\n",
      "positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet\n",
      "lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met\n",
      "with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\n",
      "gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched\n",
      "some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any\n",
      "way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\n",
      "quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\n",
      "began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for\n",
      "he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\n",
      "completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\n",
      "certain things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,\n",
      "it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being\n",
      "put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and\n",
      "perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\n",
      "matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\n",
      "life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\n",
      "take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I\n",
      "tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by\n",
      "the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his\n",
      "blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is\n",
      "the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\n",
      "vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,\n",
      "doctor?\" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to\n",
      "either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up\n",
      "his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I\n",
      "saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\n",
      "Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying\n",
      "pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: \"Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\n",
      "under auspices pleasanter to yourself,\" to which, to my astonishment, he\n",
      "replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.\n",
      "May He bless and keep you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\n",
      "me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took\n",
      "ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for\n",
      "many a long day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\n",
      "boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come\n",
      "here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have\n",
      "much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And\n",
      "Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own\n",
      "diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at\n",
      "which the Professor interrupted me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man\n",
      "should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God\n",
      "fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\n",
      "combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\n",
      "to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\n",
      "affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are\n",
      "determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is\n",
      "no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her\n",
      "in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in\n",
      "waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,\n",
      "she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to\n",
      "think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she\n",
      "must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and\n",
      "we go alone.\" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we\n",
      "had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\n",
      "the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\n",
      "to come on him. \"Oh that we had known it before!\" he said, \"for then we\n",
      "might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk\n",
      "that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think\n",
      "of that, but go on our way to the end.\" Then he fell into a silence that\n",
      "lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for\n",
      "dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\n",
      "put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not up to this moment, Professor,\" she said impulsively, \"but up to\n",
      "this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the\n",
      "little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\n",
      "has told is the worse for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It\n",
      "is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at\n",
      "present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\n",
      "what is personal. Must it go in?\" The Professor read it over gravely,\n",
      "and handed it back, saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can\n",
      "but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\n",
      "honour you--as well as more esteem and love.\" She took it back with\n",
      "another blush and a bright smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\n",
      "and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\n",
      "and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us\n",
      "have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all\n",
      "be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this\n",
      "terrible and mysterious enemy.\n",

      "_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after\n",
      "dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of\n",

      "which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit\n",
      "next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat\n",

      "to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;\n",
      "but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his\n",
      "song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are\n",
      "young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What\n",
      "say you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so\n",
      "much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I\n",
      "saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so\n",
      "strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for\n",
      "itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I\n",
      "in his; there was no need for speaking between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I answer for Mina and myself,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count me in, Professor,\" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am with you,\" said Lord Godalming, \"for Lucy's sake, if for no other\n",
      "reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his\n",
      "golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took\n",
      "his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with\n",
      "his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our\n",
      "solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even\n",
      "occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing\n",
      "went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\n",
      "had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\n",
      "as any other transaction of life:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\n",
      "without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power\n",
      "denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to\n",
      "act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.\n",
      "In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are\n",
      "free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\n",
      "achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\n",
      "restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the\n",
      "limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not\n",
      "at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay\n",
      "of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the\n",
      "first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and\n",
      "secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\n",
      "superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for\n",
      "others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would\n",
      "have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\n",
      "sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief\n",
      "that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the\n",
      "vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\n",
      "moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\n",
      "that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\n",
      "all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so\n",
      "far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at\n",
      "this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\n",
      "devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we\n",
      "have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the\n",
      "beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\n",
      "experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the\n",
      "time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the\n",
      "living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\n",
      "younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\n",
      "they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he\n",
      "cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend\n",
      "Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!\n",
      "He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again\n",
      "Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again\n",
      "Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\n",
      "from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\n",
      "from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\n",
      "bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\n",
      "saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\n",
      "the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble\n",
      "ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\n",
      "he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He\n",
      "come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\n",
      "sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw\n",
      "Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the\n",
      "tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or\n",
      "into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with\n",
      "fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,\n",
      "in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me\n",
      "through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even\n",
      "more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\n",
      "He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey\n",
      "some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the\n",
      "first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;\n",
      "though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does\n",
      "that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times\n",
      "can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is\n",
      "bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.\n",
      "These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by\n",
      "inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he\n",
      "have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place\n",
      "unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\n",
      "Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is\n",
      "said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\n",
      "of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\n",
      "power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\n",
      "symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\n",
      "them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\n",
      "silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\n",
      "lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his\n",
      "coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\n",
      "coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\n",
      "him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.\n",
      "We have seen it with our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\n",
      "him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is\n",
      "clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\n",
      "make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he\n",
      "has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his\n",
      "name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\n",
      "Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\n",
      "and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most\n",
      "cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the\n",
      "forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his\n",
      "grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says\n",
      "Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who\n",
      "were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They\n",
      "learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake\n",
      "Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the\n",
      "records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and\n",
      "'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\n",
      "spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been\n",
      "from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\n",
      "graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it\n",
      "is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\n",
      "all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,\n",
      "and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little\n",
      "pause, and then the Professor went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must\n",
      "proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\n",
      "that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\n",
      "were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes\n",
      "have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to\n",
      "ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\n",
      "where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the\n",
      "latter, we must trace----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came\n",
      "the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a\n",
      "bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\n",
      "far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\n",
      "out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\n",
      "window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice\n",
      "without:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about\n",
      "it.\" A minute later he came in and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.\n",
      "Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But\n",
      "the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat\n",
      "and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned\n",
      "brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\n",
      "have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have\n",
      "seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you hit it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\" Without\n",
      "saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\n",
      "statement:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must\n",
      "either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to\n",
      "speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.\n",
      "Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of\n",
      "noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.\n",
      "You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you\n",
      "no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men\n",
      "and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we\n",
      "shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we\n",
      "are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me\n",
      "good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their\n",
      "safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their\n",
      "minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,\n",
      "I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right\n",
      "now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save\n",
      "another victim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\n",
      "close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\n",
      "appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\n",
      "me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,\n",
      "with means to get into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can\n",
      "sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend\n",
      "to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.\n",

      "\n",
      "_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an\n",
      "urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see\n",
      "him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.\n",
      "I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\n",
      "morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't\n",
      "know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his\n",
      "violent fits.\" I knew the man would not have said this without some\n",
      "cause, so I said: \"All right; I'll go now\"; and I asked the others to\n",
      "wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \"patient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take me with you, friend John,\" said the Professor. \"His case in your\n",
      "diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_\n",
      "case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\n",
      "disturbed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I come also?\" asked Lord Godalming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me too?\" said Quincey Morris. \"May I come?\" said Harker. I nodded, and\n",
      "we all went down the passage together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\n",
      "rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an\n",
      "unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever\n",
      "met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would\n",
      "prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but\n",
      "none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would\n",
      "at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up\n",
      "with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own\n",
      "existing sanity. \"I appeal to your friends,\" he said, \"they will,\n",
      "perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have\n",
      "not introduced me.\" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of\n",
      "introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,\n",
      "besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of\n",
      "the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \"Lord\n",
      "Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.\n",
      "Renfield.\" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\n",
      "Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\n",
      "more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his\n",
      "youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\n",
      "patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great\n",
      "state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\n",
      "far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\n",
      "alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a\n",
      "vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\n",
      "place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at\n",
      "meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\n",
      "conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\n",
      "by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\n",
      "conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to\n",
      "one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by\n",
      "the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\n",
      "places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\n",
      "least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.\n",
      "And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\n",
      "well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\n",
      "be considered as under exceptional circumstances.\" He made this last\n",
      "appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\n",
      "charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the\n",
      "conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,\n",
      "that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to\n",
      "tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the\n",
      "necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it\n",
      "better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\n",
      "I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.\n",
      "So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\n",
      "to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\n",
      "in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of\n",
      "meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\n",
      "quickly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to\n",
      "go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time\n",
      "presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of\n",
      "the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put\n",
      "before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so\n",
      "momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\" He looked at me keenly, and\n",
      "seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\n",
      "them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have,\" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\n",
      "There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for\n",
      "this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore\n",
      "in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I\n",
      "am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I\n",
      "assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\n",
      "unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,\n",
      "sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which\n",
      "animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of\n",
      "your friends.\" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing\n",
      "conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was\n",
      "but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let\n",
      "him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like\n",
      "all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at\n",
      "him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\n",
      "with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone\n",
      "which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it\n",
      "afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\n",
      "to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\n",
      "without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.\n",
      "Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the\n",
      "privilege you seek.\" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\n",
      "poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the\n",
      "highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\n",
      "reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\n",
      "you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If\n",
      "you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\n",
      "we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help\n",
      "us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\" He still shook\n",
      "his head as he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and\n",
      "if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my\n",
      "own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am\n",
      "refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\" I thought it was now\n",
      "time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\n",
      "towards the door, simply saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He\n",
      "moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was\n",
      "about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were\n",
      "groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\n",
      "petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his\n",
      "emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\n",
      "relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,\n",
      "and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\n",
      "fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\n",
      "efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same\n",
      "constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of\n",
      "which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he\n",
      "wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\n",
      "sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,\n",
      "for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\n",
      "quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up\n",
      "his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a\n",
      "torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his\n",
      "whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\n",
      "of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;\n",
      "send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a\n",
      "strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go\n",
      "out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am\n",
      "speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know\n",
      "whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.\n",
      "By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\n",
      "lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out\n",
      "of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you\n",
      "understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and\n",
      "earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\n",
      "for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\n",
      "would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" I said sternly, \"no more of this; we have had quite enough\n",
      "already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,\n",
      "without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the\n",
      "bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had\n",
      "expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\n",

      "_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy\n",
      "mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am\n",
      "so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.\n",
      "Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\n",
      "all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and\n",
      "brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way\n",
      "that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and\n",
      "that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a\n",
      "little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his\n",
      "room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said\n",
      "to Dr. Seward:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the\n",
      "sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some\n",
      "serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\n",
      "chance.\" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,\n",
      "for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\n",
      "hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in\n",
      "our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.\n",
      "All is best as they are.\" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a\n",
      "dreamy kind of way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an\n",
      "ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he\n",
      "seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\n",
      "afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how\n",
      "he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my\n",
      "throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and\n",
      "master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.\n",
      "That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help\n",
      "him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He\n",
      "certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is\n",
      "best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\n",
      "help to unnerve a man.\" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand\n",
      "on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\n",
      "and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to\n",
      "hope for, except the pity of the good God?\" Lord Godalming had slipped\n",
      "away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver\n",
      "whistle, as he remarked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on\n",
      "call.\" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\n",
      "to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\n",
      "out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out\n",
      "a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\n",
      "little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\n",
      "many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the\n",
      "strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\n",
      "of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not\n",
      "amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\n",
      "in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him\n",
      "as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his\n",
      "touch. Keep this near your heart\"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver\n",
      "crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--\"put these\n",
      "flowers round your neck\"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered\n",
      "garlic blossoms--\"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this\n",
      "knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can\n",
      "fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,\n",
      "which we must not desecrate needless.\" This was a portion of Sacred\n",
      "Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others\n",
      "was similarly equipped. \"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the\n",
      "skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house\n",
      "by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a\n",
      "surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after\n",
      "a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\n",
      "clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\n",
      "it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\n",
      "Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that\n",
      "the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\n",
      "shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\n",
      "into the open door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_In manus tuas, Domine!_\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over\n",
      "the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\n",
      "lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The\n",
      "Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\n",
      "from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our\n",
      "lamps and proceeded on our search.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\n",
      "rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\n",
      "shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\n",
      "was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so\n",
      "powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\n",
      "experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,\n",
      "for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\n",
      "sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches\n",
      "deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\n",
      "my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The\n",
      "walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\n",
      "spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\n",
      "tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the\n",
      "hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They\n",
      "had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\n",
      "in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor\n",
      "lifted them. He turned to me and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know\n",
      "it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?\" I had an\n",
      "idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to\n",
      "get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings\n",
      "found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.\n",
      "\"This is the spot,\" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small\n",
      "map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence\n",
      "regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the\n",
      "bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for\n",
      "as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale\n",
      "through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we\n",
      "encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close\n",
      "quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of\n",
      "his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in\n",
      "a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and\n",
      "close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was\n",
      "an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler\n",
      "air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not\n",
      "alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the\n",
      "pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had\n",
      "become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath\n",
      "exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\n",
      "intensified its loathsomeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\n",
      "enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\n",
      "terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\n",
      "above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking\n",
      "consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\n",
      "work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\n",
      "began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\n",
      "examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some\n",
      "clue as to what has become of the rest.\" A glance was sufficient to show\n",
      "how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\n",
      "no mistaking them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,\n",
      "for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\n",
      "door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\n",
      "heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\n",
      "see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\n",
      "red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,\n",
      "as Lord Godalming said, \"I thought I saw a face, but it was only the\n",
      "shadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\n",
      "and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there\n",
      "were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\n",
      "walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I\n",
      "took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\n",
      "he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\n",
      "undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\n",
      "of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew\n",
      "back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\n",
      "seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great\n",
      "iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,\n",
      "and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\n",
      "huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver\n",
      "whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered\n",
      "from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a\n",
      "minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.\n",
      "Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\n",
      "noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\n",
      "taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had\n",
      "elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to\n",
      "swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their\n",
      "moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look\n",
      "like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the\n",
      "threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\n",
      "their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were\n",
      "multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\n",
      "on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\n",
      "recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before\n",
      "him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\n",
      "dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey\n",
      "ere the whole mass had vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\n",
      "the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\n",
      "their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\n",
      "the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\n",
      "Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of\n",
      "the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves\n",
      "in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to\n",
      "slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something\n",
      "of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our\n",
      "resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and\n",
      "bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found\n",
      "nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all\n",
      "untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.\n",
      "Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\n",
      "we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\n",
      "rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\n",
      "Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and\n",
      "locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\n",
      "when he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful. No harm has\n",
      "come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how\n",
      "many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our\n",
      "first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\n",
      "accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or\n",
      "troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\n",
      "smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have\n",
      "learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\n",
      "beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable\n",
      "to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\n",
      "call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\n",
      "to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\n",
      "from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters\n",
      "before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\n",
      "his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.\n",
      "So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity\n",
      "to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the\n",
      "stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,\n",
      "and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be\n",
      "ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\n",
      "but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\n",
      "was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\n",
      "from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\n",
      "after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\n",
      "softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than\n",
      "usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly\n",
      "thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\n",
      "deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not\n",
      "think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is\n",
      "settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet\n",
      "to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\n",
      "suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a\n",
      "sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all\n",
      "is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I\n",
      "daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such\n",
      "confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep\n",
      "dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that\n",
      "has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.\n",

      "_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\n",
      "walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it\n",
      "is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the\n",
      "brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the\n",
      "night he suddenly said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him\n",
      "this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may\n",
      "be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\n",
      "and reason so sound.\" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him\n",
      "that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to\n",
      "keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary\n",
      "instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against\n",
      "getting any false impression from my patient. \"But,\" he answered, \"I\n",
      "want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live\n",
      "things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that\n",
      "he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the\n",

      "discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a\n",
      "measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \"Don't\n",
      "you know me?\" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \"I know you well\n",

      "Dutchmen!\" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable\n",
      "sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at\n",

      "clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few\n",

      "All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight\n",
      "seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be\n",
      "stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin\n",
      "streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\n",
      "across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\n",
      "vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must\n",

      "close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\n",
      "wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\n",
      "more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\n",
      "I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\n",
      "his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\n",

      "little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\n",

      "\n",
      "I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\n",
      "was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\n",
      "hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\n",
      "usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\n",
      "upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\n",
      "clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\n",
      "around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\n",
      "came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\n",
      "grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\n",
      "had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\n",
      "make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\n",
      "limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\n",
      "my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\n",
      "tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\n",
      "mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\n",
      "could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling\n",
      "water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\n",
      "the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\n",
      "concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\n",
      "of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\n",
      "began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\n",
      "whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \"a\n",
      "pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\" Was it indeed some such\n",
      "spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\n",
      "composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\n",

      "may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way\n",

      "If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on\n",

      "track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\n",
      "deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\n",
      "had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\n",
      "Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that\n",
      "morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\n",
      "he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \"new-fangled ware'us\";\n",
      "and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\n",
      "o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\n",
      "I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\n",
      "of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\n",
      "new \"cold storage\" building; and as this suited the condition of a\n",
      "\"new-fangled ware'us,\" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\n",
      "gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\n",
      "coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\n",
      "suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for\n",
      "the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\n",
      "a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\n",
      "promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\n",
      "that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\n",
      "and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--\"main\n",
      "heavy ones\"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\n",
      "asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\n",
      "which he replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\n",
      "big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\n",
      "dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we\n",
      "tooked the bloomin' boxes from.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at\n",
      "Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\n",
      "me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,\n",
      "with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw\n",
      "a shadder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How this phrase thrilled through me!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\n",
      "me a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no\n",
      "chicken, neither.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for\n",
      "when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me\n",
      "to carry the boxes into the 'all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole nine?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was\n",
      "main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome.\" I\n",
      "interrupted him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were the boxes left in the hall?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it.\" I made one\n",
      "more attempt to further matters:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You didn't have any key?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself\n",
      "an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but\n",
      "that was the beer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you can't remember the number of the house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un\n",
      "with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I\n",
      "know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\n",
      "what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'\n",
      "they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them\n",
      "by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot\n",
      "of them went away cussin'.\" I thought that with this description I could\n",
      "find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\n",
      "off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\n",
      "could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\n",
      "precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\n",
      "distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\n",
      "unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\n",
      "westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\n",
      "described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\n",
      "arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\n",
      "untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\n",
      "up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\n",
      "had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\n",
      "a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\n",
      "roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\n",
      "Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\n",
      "whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\n",
      "been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\n",
      "given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\n",
      "experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\n",
      "but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\n",
      "discovered of gaining access to the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\n",
      "nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\n",
      "could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\n",
      "Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\n",
      "grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\n",
      "about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\n",
      "taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\n",
      "very lately there had been a notice-board of \"For Sale\" up, and that\n",
      "perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\n",
      "something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\n",
      "the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\n",
      "or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\n",
      "away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\n",
      "did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\n",
      "Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\n",
      "Sackville Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\n",
      "uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\n",
      "Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\n",
      "\"mansion\"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\n",
      "asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\n",
      "paused a few seconds before replying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is sold, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" I said, with equal politeness, \"but I have a special reason\n",
      "for wishing to know who purchased it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \"It is sold,\n",
      "sir,\" was again his laconic reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" I said, \"you do not mind letting me know so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I do mind,\" he answered. \"The affairs of their clients are\n",
      "absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\" This was\n",
      "manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\n",
      "him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\n",
      "confidence. I am myself a professional man.\" Here I handed him my card.\n",
      "\"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\n",
      "Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\n",
      "he understood, lately for sale.\" These words put a different complexion\n",
      "on affairs. He said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\n",
      "I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\n",
      "renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\n",
      "Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult\n",
      "the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\n",
      "lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\n",
      "deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\n",
      "lordship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\n",
      "gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I\n",
      "was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company\n",
      "and came down to Purfleet by the next train.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\n",
      "made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\n",
      "think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\n",
      "inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\n",
      "our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\n",
      "confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\n",
      "keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\n",
      "else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\n",
      "any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\n",
      "made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\n",
      "knowledge would be torture to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;\n",
      "so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\n",
      "amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\n",
      "The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\n",
      "as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\n",
      "came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\n",
      "difference between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\n",
      "the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\n",
      "it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\n",
      "information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\n",
      "the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\n",
      "our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\n",
      "until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\n",
      "wretch to his real death.\" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\n",
      "Morris spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say! how are we going to get into that house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\n",
      "and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\n",
      "commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't\n",
      "see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\n",
      "of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\n",
      "morning.\" Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\n",
      "about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\n",
      "another of us:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\n",
      "got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\n",
      "can find the Count's key basket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\n",
      "least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,\n",
      "we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\n",
      "while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\n",
      "bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\n",
      "moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\n",
      "forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\n",
      "in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\n",
      "did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\n",
      "herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\n",

      "_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\n",
      "rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\n",
      "always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\n",
      "than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\n",
      "repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\n",
      "He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really\n",
      "care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\n",
      "looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\n",
      "thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\n",
      "him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about the flies these times?\" He smiled on me in quite a superior\n",
      "sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\n",
      "he answered me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\n",
      "of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\n",
      "when they typified the soul as a butterfly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\n",
      "quickly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\" His madness foiled his\n",
      "reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\n",
      "with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he brightened\n",
      "up; \"I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\n",
      "have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\n",
      "study zoöphagy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\" He smiled with an\n",
      "ineffably benign superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\n",
      "Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\n",
      "may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\n",
      "purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\n",
      "spiritually!\" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\n",
      "Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\n",
      "that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why with Enoch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because he walked with God.\" I could not see the analogy, but did not\n",
      "like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?\" I put\n",
      "my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\n",
      "The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\n",
      "old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\n",
      "he replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if\n",
      "I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them\n",
      "or----\" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\n",
      "face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \"And doctor, as to\n",
      "life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you\n",
      "know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good\n",
      "friends--like you, Dr. Seward\"; this was said with a leer of\n",
      "inexpressible cunning. \"I know that I shall never lack the means of\n",
      "life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\n",
      "antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as\n",
      "he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it\n",
      "was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\n",
      "without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\n",
      "that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\n",
      "to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are\n",
      "Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the\n",
      "record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\n",
      "knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\n",
      "to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\n",
      "me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\n",
      "might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\n",
      "might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\n",
      "which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\n",
      "came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\n",
      "lips:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about souls?\" It was evident then that my surmise had been\n",
      "correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\n",
      "lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \"What about them\n",
      "yourself?\" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\n",
      "him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\n",
      "an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want any souls!\" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\n",
      "matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to \"be\n",
      "cruel only to be kind.\" So I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You like life, and you want life?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" I asked, \"how are we to get the life without getting the soul\n",
      "also?\" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with\n",
      "the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\n",
      "and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you\n",
      "know, and you must put up with their souls!\" Something seemed to affect\n",
      "his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\n",
      "screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\n",
      "soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\n",
      "me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\n",
      "though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\n",
      "was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\n",
      "and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\n",
      "to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\n",
      "go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\n",
      "speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\" He seemed to\n",
      "wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!\" After a pause he added,\n",
      "\"But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or spiders?\" I went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them\n",
      "to eat or\"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\n",
      "topic.\n",

      "_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\n",
      "as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I\n",
      "can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his\n",
      "left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it\n",
      "became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\n",
      "there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\n",
      "which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\n",
      "that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\n",
      "floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\n",
      "originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\n",
      "we turned him over:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\n",
      "the whole side of his face are paralysed.\" How such a thing could have\n",
      "happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\n",
      "bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\n",
      "beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\n",
      "Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\n",
      "might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\n",
      "kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things\n",
      "occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his\n",
      "face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\n",
      "it.\" I said to him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\n",
      "him without an instant's delay.\" The man ran off, and within a few\n",
      "minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\n",
      "he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\n",
      "then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\n",
      "said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\n",
      "attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\n",
      "If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\n",
      "he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\n",
      "extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\n",
      "evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\n",
      "looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\n",
      "conscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\n",
      "present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\n",
      "Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\n",
      "The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\n",
      "fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\n",
      "Professor thought a moment and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\n",
      "as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\n",
      "his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\n",
      "brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\n",
      "too late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\n",
      "went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\n",
      "Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\n",
      "So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\n",
      "are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\n",
      "these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\n",
      "as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more\n",
      "than we have done. May we come in?\" I nodded, and held the door open\n",
      "till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\n",
      "attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\n",
      "floor, he said softly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him\n",
      "briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\n",
      "the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\n",
      "down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\n",
      "in patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"just long enough to fix the best\n",
      "spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\n",
      "the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\n",
      "horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered\n",
      "that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\n",
      "the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\n",
      "but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\n",
      "who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in\n",
      "uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\n",
      "and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\n",
      "would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\n",
      "beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\n",
      "hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\n",
      "temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\n",
      "agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\n",
      "their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\n",
      "torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\n",
      "some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\n",
      "sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\n",
      "and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\n",
      "spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\n",
      "been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\n",
      "We shall operate just above the ear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\n",
      "breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\n",
      "prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\n",
      "Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\n",
      "This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\n",
      "surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\n",
      "convulsively, and as he did so, said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\n",
      "have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\n",
      "move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\n",
      "dreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\n",
      "eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\n",
      "Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" As he heard the voice his face\n",
      "brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\n",
      "water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"--he\n",
      "stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The\n",
      "brandy--it is in my study--quick!\" He flew and returned with a glass,\n",
      "the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\n",
      "lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\n",
      "injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\n",
      "conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\n",
      "shall never forget, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\"\n",
      "Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\n",
      "figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\" For an instant his\n",
      "eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\n",
      "bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\n",
      "hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\n",
      "and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\n",
      "again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\n",
      "crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\n",
      "me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I\n",
      "felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\n",
      "I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\n",
      "me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\n",
      "seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\n",
      "dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\" As he spoke, Van\n",
      "Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\n",
      "gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\n",
      "and said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\n",
      "but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\n",
      "man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\n",
      "teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\n",
      "of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in\n",
      "at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\n",
      "Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He\n",
      "was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\n",
      "sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\n",
      "wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\n",
      "backs.\" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\n",
      "'Death's-head Moth'?\" The patient went on without stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\n",
      "millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\n",
      "too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\n",
      "buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\n",
      "Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\n",
      "beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\n",
      "hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\n",
      "spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\n",
      "then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\n",
      "were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\n",
      "smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\n",
      "seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\n",
      "and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\n",
      "me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\n",
      "over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\n",
      "the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were\n",
      "all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\n",
      "open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\n",
      "the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\n",
      "splendour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\n",
      "he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\n",
      "the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\n",
      "back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do\n",
      "not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\n",
      "if once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\n",
      "even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\n",
      "When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\n",
      "knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\n",
      "out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\n",
      "owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same\n",
      "as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\n",
      "Harker had come into the room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\n",
      "him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\n",
      "They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\n",
      "however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\n",
      "noticing:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;\n",
      "it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved,\n",
      "but no one said a word; he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the\n",
      "same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\n",
      "in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it\n",
      "at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\n",
      "to know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that\n",
      "the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when\n",
      "He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\n",
      "grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\n",
      "as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\n",
      "Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\n",
      "with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't\n",
      "mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\n",
      "into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\n",
      "when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\n",
      "was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\n",
      "to steal away under the door.\" His voice was becoming fainter and his\n",
      "breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose.\n",
      "It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\n",
      "night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\" There was no\n",
      "need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\n",
      "common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\n",
      "had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and\n",
      "as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\n",
      "over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\n",
      "Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped; his\n",
      "voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\n",
      "my own heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\n",
      "latter said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should we disturb her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall\n",
      "break it in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's\n",
      "room!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing said solemnly, \"You are always right; but this is life and\n",
      "death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\n",
      "are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\n",
      "the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\n",
      "too, my friends. Now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\n",
      "ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\n",
      "headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\n",
      "across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\n",
      "appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\n",
      "and my heart seemed to stand still.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\n",
      "was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\n",
      "Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\n",
      "Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\n",
      "figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\n",
      "His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\n",
      "the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\n",
      "hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms\n",
      "at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\n",
      "forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\n",
      "with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which\n",
      "was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\n",
      "resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to\n",
      "compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\n",
      "face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\n",
      "into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\n",
      "of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\n",
      "white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\n",
      "champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\n",
      "his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\n",
      "and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\n",
      "and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\n",
      "Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\n",
      "the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\n",
      "lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\n",
      "great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\n",
      "under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\n",
      "looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\n",
      "open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\n",
      "forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\n",
      "it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\n",
      "seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\n",
      "few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\n",
      "ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\n",
      "her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\n",
      "blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\n",
      "poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\n",
      "Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\n",
      "which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\n",
      "endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\n",
      "over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\n",
      "despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\n",
      "do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\n",
      "herself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\n",
      "and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\n",
      "holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\n",
      "heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\n",
      "window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\n",
      "Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\n",
      "yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\n",
      "instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial\n",
      "consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\n",
      "be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\n",
      "then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\n",
      "started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\n",
      "him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\n",
      "however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\n",
      "her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In God's name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr.\n",
      "Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\n",
      "what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\n",
      "this!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\n",
      "together. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick\n",
      "movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\n",
      "man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened?\n",
      "Tell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you\n",
      "love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\n",
      "far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror\n",
      "and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\n",
      "forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\n",
      "to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\n",
      "with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her\n",
      "expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\n",
      "pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\n",
      "little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\n",
      "foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\n",
      "and take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down\n",
      "her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white\n",
      "night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\n",
      "the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\n",
      "saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\n",
      "sobs:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\n",
      "should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\n",
      "most cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\n",
      "hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\n",
      "deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\n",
      "if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" He put out\n",
      "his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\n",
      "sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\n",
      "damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\n",
      "while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\n",
      "me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\n",
      "power to the utmost:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\n",
      "fact; tell me all that has been.\" I told him exactly what had happened,\n",
      "and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\n",
      "and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\n",
      "held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\n",
      "the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\n",
      "see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\n",
      "the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\n",
      "hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\n",
      "They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\n",
      "questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\n",
      "their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\n",
      "and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\n",
      "to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\n",
      "answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\n",
      "looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\n",
      "however----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\n",
      "the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\n",
      "is in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\n",
      "seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\n",
      "burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\n",
      "cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\n",
      "had helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the\n",
      "other copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\n",
      "went on: \"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\n",
      "into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he\n",
      "paused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\n",
      "moistening his lips with his tongue, added: \"except that the poor fellow\n",
      "is dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\n",
      "us she said solemnly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God's will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\n",
      "something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\n",
      "Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I\n",
      "can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\n",
      "go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\n",
      "Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\n",
      "shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\n",
      "will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\n",
      "dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\n",
      "a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\n",
      "hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\n",
      "hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\n",
      "happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\n",
      "need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\n",
      "quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\n",
      "end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\n",
      "learn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\n",
      "as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\n",
      "lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\n",
      "out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\n",
      "kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\n",
      "of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\n",
      "After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\n",
      "began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\n",
      "long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\n",
      "of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\n",
      "connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\"\n",
      "Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\n",
      "lovingly: \"Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\n",
      "through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\n",
      "to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\n",
      "need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\n",
      "with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\n",
      "sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\n",
      "more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\n",
      "next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\n",
      "had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\n",
      "it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\n",
      "terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\n",
      "I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\n",
      "seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\n",
      "tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\n",
      "looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\n",
      "the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\n",
      "had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\n",
      "tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\n",
      "the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\n",
      "fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\n",
      "teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\n",
      "sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\n",
      "red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\n",
      "my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\n",
      "paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\n",
      "pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\n",
      "before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\n",
      "say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\n",
      "and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\n",
      "so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\n",
      "be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\n",
      "appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\n",
      "want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\n",
      "such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\n",
      "me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned\n",
      "again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\n",
      "he were the injured one, and went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\n",
      "this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\n",
      "must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\n",
      "saw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to\n",
      "overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\n",
      "husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\n",
      "went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play\n",
      "your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\n",
      "frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\n",

      "should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\n",
      "played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\n",
      "for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\n",
      "born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\n",
      "to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\n",
      "wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\n",
      "helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\n",
      "minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\n",
      "have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\n",

      "do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his\n",
      "shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\n",
      "the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\n",
      "them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\n",
      "the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\n",
      "my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\n",
      "fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\n",

      "_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\n",
      "is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\n",
      "take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\n",
      "that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\n",
      "knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\n",
      "not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\n",
      "the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\n",
      "not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\n",
      "we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\n",
      "running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\n",
      "faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\n",
      "up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\n",
      "Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\n",
      "told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\n",
      "they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\n",
      "all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\n",
      "heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\n",
      "half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\n",
      "had called out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" after that there\n",
      "was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\n",
      "on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\n",
      "asked if he had heard \"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not\n",
      "say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\n",
      "there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\n",
      "to it, if required, that the word \"God\" was spoken by the patient. Dr.\n",
      "Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\n",
      "the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\n",
      "would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\n",
      "it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a\n",
      "certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\n",
      "coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\n",
      "to the same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\n",
      "step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\n",
      "confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\n",
      "kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\n",
      "to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\n",
      "despair. \"There must be no concealment,\" she said, \"Alas! we have had\n",
      "too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\n",
      "give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\n",
      "Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\"\n",
      "Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\n",
      "but quietly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\n",
      "others from yourself, after what has happened?\" Her face grew set in its\n",
      "lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\n",
      "answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah no! for my mind is made up!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\n",
      "our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\n",
      "came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\n",
      "harm to any that I love, I shall die!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\n",
      "pain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she\n",
      "spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\n",
      "put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\n",
      "could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\n",
      "even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\n",
      "child----\" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\n",
      "throat; he gulped it down and went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\n",
      "die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\n",
      "the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\n",
      "die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\n",
      "you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\n",
      "live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\n",
      "himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\n",
      "night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\n",
      "do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.\" The\n",
      "poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\n",
      "quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\n",
      "silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\n",
      "him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\n",
      "strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\n",
      "have passed away from me.\" She was so good and brave that we all felt\n",
      "that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\n",
      "began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\n",
      "the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\n",
      "might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\n",
      "She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if \"pleased\" could\n",
      "be used in connection with so grim an interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\n",
      "prepared with an exact ordering of our work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to\n",
      "Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\n",
      "there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\n",
      "would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\n",
      "effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\n",
      "intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\n",
      "power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\n",
      "them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\n",
      "to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\n",
      "Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\n",
      "and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\n",
      "guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\n",
      "retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\n",
      "of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\n",
      "through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\n",
      "must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\n",
      "all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\n",
      "him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\n",
      "and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\" Here I started up for I\n",
      "could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\n",
      "preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,\n",
      "since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\n",
      "his hand warningly. \"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the\n",
      "quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\n",
      "act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\n",
      "all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\n",
      "The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\n",
      "deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\n",
      "write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\n",
      "that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\n",
      "where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\n",
      "very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\n",
      "search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\n",
      "friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we\n",
      "run down our old fox--so? is it not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let us come at once,\" I cried, \"we are wasting the precious,\n",
      "precious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\n",
      "reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\n",
      "in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\n",
      "your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\n",
      "movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\n",
      "seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\n",
      "into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\" I nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\n",
      "not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the\n",
      "housebreaker, what would you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\n",
      "lock for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is\n",
      "the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\n",
      "whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\n",
      "police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\n",
      "the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\n",
      "friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this\n",
      "your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such\n",
      "things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,\n",
      "no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine\n",
      "house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland\n",
      "and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and\n",
      "got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out\n",
      "and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he\n",
      "have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;\n",
      "and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of\n",
      "that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him\n",
      "that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away\n",
      "within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all\n",
      "they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland\n",
      "he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done\n",
      "_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go\n",
      "so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem\n",
      "it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many\n",
      "about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the\n",
      "house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's\n",
      "face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van\n",
      "Helsing went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\n",
      "us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\n",
      "more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Godalming stood up. \"I can be of some use here,\" he said. \"I shall\n",
      "wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\n",
      "convenient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, old fellow,\" said Morris, \"it is a capital idea to have all\n",
      "ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one\n",
      "of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of\n",
      "Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?\n",
      "It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\n",
      "even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend Quincey is right!\" said the Professor. \"His head is what you\n",
      "call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to\n",
      "do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\n",
      "that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\n",
      "terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost\n",
      "ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\n",
      "somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give\n",
      "her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\n",
      "what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As\n",
      "yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\n",
      "was short, and there was time for fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the\n",
      "disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was\n",
      "finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\n",
      "Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we\n",
      "should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\n",
      "presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\n",
      "some new clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\n",
      "after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\n",
      "that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\n",
      "and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.\n",
      "It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count\n",
      "might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be\n",
      "able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to\n",
      "follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as\n",
      "my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect\n",
      "Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would\n",
      "not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter\n",
      "in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be\n",
      "some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;\n",
      "and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to\n",
      "cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's\n",
      "resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that\n",
      "we should all work together. \"As for me,\" she said, \"I have no fear.\n",
      "Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must\n",
      "have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if\n",
      "He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\" So I\n",
      "started up crying out: \"Then in God's name let us come at once, for we\n",
      "are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we\n",
      "think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so!\" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you forget,\" he said, with actually a smile, \"that last night he\n",
      "banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that\n",
      "terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\n",
      "the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\n",
      "shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her\n",
      "frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in\n",
      "the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,\n",
      "he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. \"Oh,\n",
      "Madam Mina,\" he said, \"dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so\n",
      "reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old\n",
      "lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will\n",
      "forget it, will you not?\" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took\n",
      "his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I\n",
      "have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\n",
      "together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we\n",
      "must all eat that we may be strong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and\n",
      "encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\n",
      "us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we\n",
      "all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's\n",
      "lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\" We all assured\n",
      "him. \"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\n",
      "here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall\n",
      "return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I\n",
      "have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\n",
      "of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard\n",
      "yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the\n",
      "name of the Father, the Son, and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he\n",
      "had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned\n",
      "into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor\n",
      "darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as\n",
      "her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that\n",
      "her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the\n",
      "words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased\n",
      "to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her\n",
      "knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair\n",
      "over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must\n",
      "bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\" They\n",
      "all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\n",
      "grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our\n",
      "sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\n",
      "their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said\n",
      "gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\n",
      "way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,\n",
      "as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of\n",
      "the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam\n",
      "Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that\n",
      "red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,\n",
      "and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as\n",
      "we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the\n",
      "burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did\n",
      "in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of\n",
      "His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other\n",
      "through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and\n",
      "fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.\n",
      "Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old\n",
      "man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all\n",
      "knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each\n",
      "other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the\n",
      "head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help\n",
      "and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which\n",
      "neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.\n",
      "\n",
      "To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a\n",
      "vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible\n",
      "land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant\n",
      "many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so\n",
      "the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\n",
      "the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\n",
      "surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such\n",
      "fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there\n",
      "not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded\n",
      "with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and\n",
      "in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.\n",
      "Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this\n",
      "earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far\n",
      "distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has\n",
      "been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\n",
      "holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to\n",
      "God.\" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and\n",
      "very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled\n",
      "musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention\n",
      "was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the\n",
      "Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down\n",
      "the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left\n",
      "them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion\n",
      "of the Host.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can\n",
      "be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam\n",
      "Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\n",
      "train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the\n",
      "window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to\n",
      "tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in\n",
      "reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her\n",
      "hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station\n",
      "and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the\n",
      "platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have written this in the train.\n",

      "\n",
      "_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\n",
      "Lord Godalming said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in\n",
      "case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it\n",
      "wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a\n",
      "solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you\n",
      "should have known better.\" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger\n",
      "even of odium, but he went on: \"Besides, it will attract less attention\n",
      "if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with\n",
      "the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had\n",
      "better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,\n",
      "somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and\n",
      "the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the\n",
      "lookout for you, and shall let you in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The advice is good!\" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming\n",
      "and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner\n",
      "of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green\n",
      "Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was\n",
      "centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst\n",
      "its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench\n",
      "within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little\n",
      "attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we\n",
      "waited for the coming of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely\n",
      "fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended\n",
      "a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid\n",
      "the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two\n",
      "ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.\n",
      "The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes\n",
      "of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered\n",
      "along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down\n",
      "placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a\n",
      "selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly\n",
      "fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and\n",
      "turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and\n",
      "the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\n",
      "began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling\n",
      "about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the\n",
      "door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\n",
      "entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van\n",
      "Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the\n",
      "workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly\n",
      "open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.\n",
      "This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and\n",
      "gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his\n",
      "coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole\n",
      "transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at\n",
      "the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood\n",
      "Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The place smells so vilely,\" said the latter as we came in. It did\n",
      "indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\n",
      "previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the\n",
      "place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together\n",
      "in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal\n",
      "with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the\n",
      "house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found\n",
      "eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!\n",
      "Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the\n",
      "missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out\n",
      "across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,\n",
      "pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no\n",
      "windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not\n",
      "lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had\n",
      "brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\n",
      "treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the\n",
      "Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for\n",
      "any of his effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,\n",
      "we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\n",
      "which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\n",
      "them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\n",
      "table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;\n",
      "deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\n",
      "note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin\n",
      "wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes\n",
      "brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\n",
      "dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a\n",
      "little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\n",
      "the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\n",
      "and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the\n",
      "houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\n",
      "bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us\n",
      "are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of\n",
      "the Count.\n",

      "_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for\n",
      "the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep\n",
      "our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent\n",
      "purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.\n",
      "The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.\n",
      "Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful\n",
      "face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,\n",
      "haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning\n",
      "eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in\n",
      "fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if\n",
      "all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,\n",
      "in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I\n",
      "thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows\n",
      "this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he\n",
      "has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So\n",
      "well as I can remember, here it is:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all\n",
      "the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the\n",
      "greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there\n",
      "are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of\n",
      "it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,\n",
      "he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and\n",
      "alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\n",
      "science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\n",
      "compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to\n",
      "attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time\n",
      "that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the\n",
      "physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.\n",
      "In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\n",
      "growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\n",
      "man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\n",
      "been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\n",
      "fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\n",
      "lead through Death, not Life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harker groaned and said, \"And this is all arrayed against my darling!\n",
      "But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\n",
      "surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as\n",
      "yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\n",
      "things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means\n",
      "to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\n",
      "and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fail to understand,\" said Harker wearily. \"Oh, do be more plain to\n",
      "me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this\n",
      "monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been\n",
      "making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend\n",
      "John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when\n",
      "and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by\n",
      "an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not\n",
      "see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He\n",
      "knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great\n",
      "child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\n",
      "might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he\n",
      "found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he\n",
      "progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\n",
      "they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So\n",
      "that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his\n",
      "form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his\n",
      "hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him\n",
      "just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;\n",
      "and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he\n",
      "can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is\n",
      "there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even\n",
      "more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be\n",
      "well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our\n",
      "day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are\n",
      "five of us when those absent ones return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the\n",
      "double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the\n",
      "hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to\n",
      "keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a\n",
      "despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the\n",
      "direction, opened it and read aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and\n",
      "hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want\n",
      "to see you: Mina.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\" Van Helsing turned to him\n",
      "quickly and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice\n",
      "as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I care for nothing now,\" he answered hotly, \"except to wipe out this\n",
      "brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, hush, hush, my child!\" said Van Helsing. \"God does not purchase\n",
      "souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep\n",
      "faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your\n",
      "devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be\n",
      "doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are\n",
      "all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is\n",
      "coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,\n",
      "and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive\n",
      "here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times\n",
      "before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for\n",
      "is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there\n",
      "came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary\n",
      "knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\n",
      "the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and\n",
      "together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\n",
      "armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van\n",
      "Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\n",
      "back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts\n",
      "must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\n",
      "saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed\n",
      "the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the\n",
      "hall:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we\n",
      "destroyed them all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Destroyed?\" asked the Professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For him!\" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up\n",
      "by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker\n",
      "alone after sunset.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will be here before long now,\" said Van Helsing, who had been\n",
      "consulting his pocket-book. \"_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went\n",
      "south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\n",
      "only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\n",
      "o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only\n",
      "suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\n",
      "suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a\n",
      "short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to\n",
      "Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be\n",
      "carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not\n",
      "have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\n",
      "we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your\n",
      "arms! Be ready!\" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\n",
      "hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\n",
      "dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and\n",
      "adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\n",
      "been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\n",
      "accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be\n",
      "renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once\n",
      "laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\n",
      "gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\n",
      "just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\n",
      "guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\n",
      "Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\n",
      "move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the\n",
      "seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along\n",
      "the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\n",
      "he feared it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past\n",
      "us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something\n",
      "so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed\n",
      "to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was\n",
      "Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\n",
      "leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a\n",
      "horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long\n",
      "and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of\n",
      "lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single\n",
      "impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some\n",
      "better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\n",
      "we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\n",
      "avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had\n",
      "ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The\n",
      "blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's\n",
      "leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne\n",
      "through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\n",
      "making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold\n",
      "fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a\n",
      "moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife\n",
      "aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a\n",
      "protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I\n",
      "felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\n",
      "saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\n",
      "by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of\n",
      "hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\n",
      "the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\n",
      "of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\n",
      "pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous\n",
      "dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\n",
      "a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw\n",
      "himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,\n",
      "he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the\n",
      "shivering glass I could hear the \"ting\" of the gold, as some of the\n",
      "sovereigns fell on the flagging.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up\n",
      "the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\n",
      "There he turned and spoke to us:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like\n",
      "sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think\n",
      "you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is\n",
      "just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your\n",
      "girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and\n",
      "others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my\n",
      "jackals when I want to feed. Bah!\" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed\n",
      "quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\n",
      "fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us\n",
      "to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\n",
      "him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he\n",
      "fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His\n",
      "very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You\n",
      "follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For\n",
      "me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\n",
      "return.\" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\n",
      "the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\n",
      "remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\n",
      "a match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\n",
      "lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,\n",
      "bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\n",
      "was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\n",
      "of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to\n",
      "recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\n",
      "Professor when he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do\n",
      "just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need\n",
      "not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find\n",
      "it; when that is done all may yet be well.\" I could see that he spoke as\n",
      "bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken\n",
      "down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he\n",
      "was thinking of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\n",
      "waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\n",
      "bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as\n",
      "pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\n",
      "in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\" As she spoke,\n",
      "she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--\"Lay your\n",
      "poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect\n",
      "us if He so will it in His good intent.\" The poor fellow groaned. There\n",
      "was no place for words in his sublime misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us\n",
      "all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry\n",
      "people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense\n",
      "of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less\n",
      "miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to\n",
      "our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and\n",
      "although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\n",
      "threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\n",
      "manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the\n",
      "part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to\n",
      "her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\n",
      "protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,\n",
      "till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up\n",
      "to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she\n",
      "stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the\n",
      "scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty\n",
      "of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which\n",
      "she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\n",
      "teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\n",
      "our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\n",
      "we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\n",
      "purity and faith, was outcast from God.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jonathan,\" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was\n",
      "so full of love and tenderness, \"Jonathan dear, and you all my true,\n",
      "true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this\n",
      "dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as\n",
      "you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;\n",
      "but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this\n",
      "misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when\n",
      "he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have\n",
      "spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may\n",
      "not hold your hands from his destruction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as\n",
      "though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.\n",
      "Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his\n",
      "knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\n",
      "must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\n",
      "than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing\n",
      "his hand from hers as he spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\n",
      "earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send\n",
      "his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,\n",
      "Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just\n",
      "think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\n",
      "... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some\n",
      "other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,\n",
      "my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\n",
      "had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\n",
      "your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and\n",
      "sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\n",
      "of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\n",
      "so many sorrows have come.\"\n",

      "We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept\n",
      "openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.\n",
      "Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\n",
      "round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned\n",
      "to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\n",
      "with their God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\n",
      "of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\n",
      "She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\n",
      "husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,\n",
      "I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at\n",
      "hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.\n",
      "When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\n",
      "sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\n",
      "poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us\n",
      "shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,\n",

      "shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.\" I\n",
      "went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing\n",

      "short!\" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\n",
      "from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina\n",
      "gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\n",
      "like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually\n",
      "her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of\n",
      "her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few\n",
      "more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was\n",
      "covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she\n",
      "did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and\n",
      "her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to\n",
      "impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.\n",
      "They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the\n",
      "foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The\n",
      "stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone\n",
      "which would not break the current of her thoughts:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you?\" The answer came in a neutral way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\" For several\n",
      "minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\n",
      "staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room\n",
      "was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van\n",
      "Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed\n",
      "just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse\n",
      "itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you now?\" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it\n",
      "were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the\n",
      "same tone when reading her shorthand notes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then you are on a ship?\" We all looked at each other, trying to glean\n",
      "something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came\n",
      "quick:--\n",

      "\"Oh, yes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else do you hear?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\n",

      "moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see\n",

      "him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also\n",
      "with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking\n",

      "\"No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for\n",

      "became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as\n",
      "was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,\n",

      "when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and\n",
      "asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied\n",

      "blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\n",
      "with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\n",
      "on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.\n",
      "Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and\n",
      "all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was\n",
      "of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears\n",
      "exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\n",
      "picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up\n",
      "and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any\n",
      "of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship\n",
      "went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the\n",

      "our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\n",
      "Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\n",
      "we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope\n",
      "is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\n",
      "he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There\n",
      "are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about\n",
      "where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\n",
      "invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in\n",
      "Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\n",
      "his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.\n",
      "When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\n",
      "have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not\n",

      "pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that\n",
      "he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,\n",
      "at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\n",
      "forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some\n",
      "of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst\n",
      "men:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,\n",
      "and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm\n",
      "already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\n",
      "time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\n",
      "darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my\n",
      "dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\n",
      "in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his\n",
      "own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\n",
      "of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\n",
      "work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do\n",
      "what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\n",
      "been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of\n",
      "nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\n",
      "some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\n",
      "all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\n",
      "world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.\n",
      "There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\n",
      "of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,\n",
      "there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of\n",
      "occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in\n",
      "himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike\n",
      "time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,\n",
      "more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in\n",
      "strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and\n",
      "thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which\n",
      "is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,\n",
      "and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have\n",
      "infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for\n",
      "good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do\n",
      "no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and\n",
      "so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,\n",
      "shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together\n",
      "that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the\n",
      "world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,\n",
      "whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one\n",
      "soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\n",
      "more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if\n",
      "we fall, we fall in good cause.\" He paused and I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven\n",
      "from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\n",
      "which he has been hunted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" he said, \"your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\n",
      "adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once\n",
      "tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl\n",
      "unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a\n",
      "tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he\n",
      "is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go\n",
      "over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be\n",
      "beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.\n",
      "Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to\n",
      "him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What\n",
      "does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for\n",
      "him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He\n",
      "find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He\n",
      "study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old\n",
      "ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new\n",
      "land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that\n",

      "death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More\n",
      "than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether\n",
      "the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I\n",
      "caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was\n",
      "brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the\n",
      "matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our\n",
      "trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her\n",
      "trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\n",
      "recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to\n",
      "meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of\n",
      "action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\n",
      "rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\n",
      "that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_\n",
      "that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\n",
      "guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\n",
      "cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\n",
      "he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of\n",
      "that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The\n",
      "Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \"the\n",
      "Vampire's baptism of blood.\" Well, there may be a poison that distils\n",
      "itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\n",
      "a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my\n",
      "instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a\n",
      "terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same\n",
      "power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think\n",
      "further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\n",

      "_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\n",
      "things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to\n",
      "say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating\n",
      "about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just\n",
      "at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our\n",
      "confidence\"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold shiver ran\n",
      "through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing\n",
      "continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\n",
      "before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than\n",
      "ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I\n",
      "can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now\n",
      "but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\n",
      "without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\n",
      "are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\n",
      "often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she\n",
      "wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If\n",
      "it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\n",
      "hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\n",
      "have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\n",
      "will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\" I nodded\n",
      "acquiescence; he went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\n",
      "our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful\n",
      "task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.\n",
      "When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\n",
      "to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\n",
      "us.\" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\n",
      "at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\n",
      "soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\n",
      "to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at\n",
      "any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the\n",
      "effect was as I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has\n",
      "gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I\n",

      "_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\n",
      "experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a\n",
      "message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\n",
      "she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\n",
      "without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each\n",
      "other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own\n",
      "part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was\n",
      "much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we\n",
      "agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\n",
      "preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to\n",
      "confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van\n",
      "Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take\n",
      "her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to\n",
      "reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.\n",
      "Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such\n",
      "weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if\n",
      "we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\n",
      "then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite\n",
      "safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate\n",
      "be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\n",
      "preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed\n",
      "against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\" Here Quincey Morris\n",
      "added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\n",
      "that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to\n",
      "our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\n",
      "trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\n",
      "after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater\n",
      "apiece!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is\n",
      "level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\n",
      "dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we\n",
      "can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of\n",
      "us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.\n",
      "To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we\n",
      "four can set out on our journey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We four?\" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\n",
      "us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course!\" answered the Professor quickly, \"you must remain to take\n",
      "care of your so sweet wife!\" Harker was silent for awhile and then said\n",
      "in a hollow voice:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with\n",
      "Mina.\" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not\n",
      "to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him\n",
      "significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and\n",

      "_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I\n",
      "could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\n",
      "wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not\n",
      "to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not\n",
      "argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from\n",

      "last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\n",
      "more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly\n",

      "evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\n",
      "lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at\n",
      "once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A\n",
      "promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be\n",
      "broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\n",
      "tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\n",
      "do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\n",
      "from the promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise!\" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\n",
      "to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.\n",
      "She said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for\n",
      "the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or\n",

      "solemnly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise!\" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\n",

      "So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\n",
      "somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall\n",
      "of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired\n",
      "early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing\n",
      "that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible\n",
      "trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.\n",

      "for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\n",
      "him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\n",
      "opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\n",

      "I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by\n",
      "wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.\" God saw the look that\n",
      "she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel\n",
      "that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her\n",
      "hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of\n",
      "tears. She went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you\n",
      "can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had\n",
      "to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me\n",
      "and so learn that which even I myself do not know.\" Dr. Van Helsing said\n",
      "very gravely:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and\n",
      "together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.\" When he had\n",
      "spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen\n",
      "back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up\n",
      "the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing\n",
      "motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within\n",
      "a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a\n",
      "new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony\n",
      "to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are\n",
      "warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be\n",
      "ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified\n",
      "the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall\n",
      "fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the\n",
      "superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was\n",
      "man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,\n",
      "when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we\n",
      "shall open the box, and--and all will be well.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand\n",
      "men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!\" I\n",
      "grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.\n",

      "such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a\n",

      "tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\n",
      "old wandering days it meant \"action.\" Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so\n",
      "that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\n",
      "meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the\n",
      "dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his\n",
      "action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of\n",
      "the great Kukri knife and rested there. \"When does the next train start\n",
      "for Galatz?\" said Van Helsing to us generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!\" We all started, for the answer came from\n",
      "Mrs. Harker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How on earth do you know?\" said Art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\n",
      "does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\n",
      "always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\n",
      "husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\n",
      "the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\n",
      "Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\n",
      "learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\n",
      "as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wonderful woman!\" murmured the Professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't we get a special?\" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\n",
      "head: \"I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\n",
      "if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\n",
      "regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\n",
      "Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\n",
      "tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\n",
      "you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\n",
      "letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\n",
      "just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\n",
      "his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\n",
      "smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\n",
      "with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\n",
      "may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\n",
      "with Madam to make report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I,\" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\n",
      "had been for many a long day, \"shall try to be of use in all ways, and\n",
      "shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\n",
      "from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\"\n",
      "The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\n",
      "realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\n",
      "each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\n",
      "time, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\n",
      "Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\n",
      "Harker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\n",
      "was shut upon her he said to me:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We mean the same! speak out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\n",
      "deceive us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" said I, \"unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\n",
      "you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\n",
      "but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\n",
      "words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\n",
      "the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\n",
      "mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\n",
      "with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\n",
      "then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\n",
      "eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\n",
      "Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\n",
      "but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\n",
      "so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\n",
      "have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\n",
      "come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\n",
      "that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\n",
      "therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\n",
      "She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\n",
      "we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\n",
      "brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have\n",
      "a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\n",
      "altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\n",
      "learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\n",
      "feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\n",
      "just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\n",
      "himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\n",
      "the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\n",
      "forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\n",
      "of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\n",
      "brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\n",
      "thumb he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,\n",
      "dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\n",
      "think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\n",
      "let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\n",
      "where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\n",
      "at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\n",
      "strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \"Ugly Duck\" of my friend\n",
      "Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\n",
      "sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\n",
      "read here what Jonathan have written:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\n",
      "his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\n",
      "beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\n",
      "alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\n",
      "since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\n",
      "from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\n",
      "it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\n",
      "yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then\n",
      "pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\n",
      "and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\n",
      "leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\n",
      "study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is\n",
      "a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not\n",
      "but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad\n",
      "universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\n",
      "in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\n",
      "from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to\n",
      "be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true\n",
      "criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\n",
      "This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\n",
      "resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\n",
      "child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\n",
      "also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\n",
      "have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\n",
      "by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\n",
      "him the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said\n",
      "Archimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,\n",
      "is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\n",
      "the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\n",
      "just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\n",
      "opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\" for\n",
      "Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\n",
      "those so bright eyes.\" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\n",
      "His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\n",
      "unconsciously, as she spoke:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\n",
      "so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\n",
      "Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\n",
      "clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\n",
      "lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\n",
      "'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had\n",
      "tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\n",
      "for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\n",
      "So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\n",
      "hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\n",
      "the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\n",
      "from Turkey Land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!\" said Van Helsing,\n",
      "enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\n",

      "consultation:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\" Turning to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\"\n",

      "\"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\n",
      "and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\n",
      "purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\n",
      "leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\n",
      "safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\n",
      "from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\n",
      "night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\n",
      "is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\n",
      "is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\n",
      "his ends.\" The Professor stood up:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\n",
      "whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\n",
      "Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\n",
      "But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\n",
      "God's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\n",
      "his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\n",
      "in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\n",
      "is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\n",
      "many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\n",
      "sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\n",
      "there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\n",
      "terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\n",
      "in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\n",
      "sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\n",
      "and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\n",
      "suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\n",
      "it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\n",
      "knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\n",
      "that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\n",
      "hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\n",
      "ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\n",
      "hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\n",
      "and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\n",
      "you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\"\n",

      "_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last\n",
      "night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us\n",
      "had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\n",
      "and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and\n",
      "for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\n",
      "Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\n",
      "more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\n",
      "necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\n",
      "this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\n",
      "resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\n",
      "steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\n",
      "men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\n",
      "the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\n",
      "There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\n",
      "along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\n",
      "blowing upon me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\n",
      "on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\n",
      "weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\n",
      "Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\n",
      "Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\n",
      "was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\n",
      "passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\n",
      "sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\" We\n",
      "could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\n",
      "tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his\n",
      "earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\n",
      "hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\n",
      "not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\n",
      "in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\n",
      "at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\n",
      "be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\n",
      "may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\n",
      "shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\n",
      "We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\n",
      "on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\n",
      "true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;\n",
      "at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\n",
      "response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\n",
      "than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\n",
      "so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\n",
      "soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\n",
      "reply:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\n",
      "of wood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till\n",
      "to-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\n",
      "expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;\n",
      "but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot\n",
      "possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more\n",
      "hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw\n",
      "more light on what is happening.\n",

      "_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when\n",
      "there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a\n",
      "station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\n",
      "Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\n",
      "this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's\n",
      "sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that\n",
      "her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance\n",
      "hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes\n",
      "on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power\n",
      "over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be\n",
      "a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did\n",
      "speak, her words were enigmatical:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can\n",
      "hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,\n",
      "fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\" She stopped and a\n",
      "shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,\n",
      "till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even\n",
      "in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from\n",
      "the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was\n",
      "all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;\n",
      "when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\n",
      "silence.\n",

      "Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\n",

      "effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonised\n",
      "voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun\n",

      "As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent\n",
      "invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of\n",
      "exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.\n",
      "The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel\n",

      "also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but\n",
      "there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to\n",
      "Hildesheim.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_\n",
      "made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's\n",
      "suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness\n",
      "played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind\n",
      "through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the\n",
      "Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared\n",
      "the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here\n",
      "we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\n",
      "moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been\n",

      "appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to\n",

      "with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's\n",
      "remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general\n",
      "feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his\n",
      "castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from\n",
      "the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks\n",
      "who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.\n",
      "Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this\n",
      "service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he\n",
      "came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\n",
      "arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and\n",
      "he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\n",
      "by murdering his agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the\n",
      "Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in\n",
      "the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling\n",
      "level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,\n",
      "was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or\n",
      "poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There\n",
      "would be no such sound if floating down stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may\n",
      "possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more\n",
      "easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza\n",

      "_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\n",
      "took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\n",
      "not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\n",
      "heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\n",
      "left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\n",
      "provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\n",
      "could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\n",
      "habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\n",
      "walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\n",
      "clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\n",
      "the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\n",
      "Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\n",
      "perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\n",
      "seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\n",
      "on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\n",
      "could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\n",
      "sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\n",
      "full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\n",
      "that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\n",
      "exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\n",
      "could trace it through the drifted snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\n",
      "him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\n",
      "with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\n",
      "hand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and\n",
      "if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our\n",
      "furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\n",
      "forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\n",
      "repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\n",
      "not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\n",
      "reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\n",
      "of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the\n",
      "rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\n",
      "more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\n",
      "to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\n",
      "snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\n",
      "were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\n",
      "white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\n",
      "kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\n",
      "off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\n",
      "group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\n",
      "long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail\n",
      "wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\n",
      "snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were\n",
      "peasants or gypsies of some kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\n",
      "felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\n",
      "well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\n",
      "there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\n",
      "pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\n",
      "however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\n",
      "the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\n",
      "night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from\n",
      "me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\n",
      "\"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\n",
      "galloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow\n",
      "voice:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be\n",
      "done!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\n",
      "landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\n",
      "glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\n",
      "south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\n",
      "blots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\n",
      "and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\n",
      "At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\n",
      "I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\n",
      "break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\n",
      "of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\n",
      "the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\n",
      "and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\n",
      "laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\n",
      "opening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the\n",
      "time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver\n",
      "ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\n",
      "louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\n",
      "It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\n",
      "and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\n",
      "towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\n",
      "see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\n",
      "numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\n",
      "fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\n",
      "circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;\n",
      "but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\n",
      "clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\n",
      "late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\n",
      "with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\n",
      "sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\n",
      "than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\n",
      "bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\n",
      "and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\n",
      "had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\n",
      "the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\n",
      "party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\n",
      "not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\n",
      "seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\n",
      "and lower on the mountain tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\n",
      "our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\n",
      "that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan's,\n",
      "raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute\n",
      "tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\n",
      "there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\n",
      "spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\n",
      "and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\n",
      "other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\n",
      "horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\n",
      "companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\n",
      "forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\n",
      "unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\n",
      "Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\n",
      "Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\n",
      "up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\n",
      "gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\n",
      "himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\n",
      "front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\n",
      "tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\n",
      "For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\n",
      "and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\n",
      "Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\n",
      "upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\n",
      "surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\n",
      "parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\n",
      "formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\n",
      "shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\n",
      "order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\n",
      "of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\n",
      "evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\n",
      "should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\n",
      "levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\n",
      "the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\n",
      "attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\n",
      "purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\n",
      "cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\n",
      "cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\n",
      "box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\n",
      "Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\n",
      "Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\n",
      "with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\n",
      "seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\n",
      "they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\n",
      "I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\n",
      "beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\n",
      "with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\n",
      "spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\n",
      "as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\n",
      "attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\n",
      "the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\n",
      "lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\n",
      "the top of the box was thrown back.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\n",
      "and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\n",
      "no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\n",
      "shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\n",
      "lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\n",
      "the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\n",
      "image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\n",
      "knew too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\n",
      "turned to triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.\n",
      "I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\n",
      "moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\n",
      "drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\n",
      "our sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\n",
      "dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\n",
      "could have imagined might have rested there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\n",
      "of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\n",
      "setting sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\n",
      "disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\n",
      "if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\n",
      "leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\n",
      "which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\n",
      "us alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\n",
      "hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\n",
      "flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\n",
      "two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\n",
      "head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\n",
      "in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\n",
      "my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried\n",
      "suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was\n",
      "worth for this to die! Look! look!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\n",
      "fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\n",
      "the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all\n",
      "as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\n",
      "spoke:--\n",
