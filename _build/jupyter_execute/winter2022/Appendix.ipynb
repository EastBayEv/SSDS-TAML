    "\n",
    "When operating in Python, you'll often hear/read the advice that you should set up a \"virtual environment\" for each project you are working on. What exactly is a virtual environment, and why do you need one for every project? \n",
    "\n",
    "* From Python's official documentation: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a \"system\" Python; i.e., the version of Python which is installed as part of your operating system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, activating your project in a virtual environment allows it to become it's own self-contained application. A few advantages of doing this include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows you to download packages into your project without administrator privileges/status. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Compartmentalizes your project materials for easy sharing and replication. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Avoids inter-project conflicts regarding versions and dependencies for packages.*\n",
    "\n",
    "That last point can become especially relevant as you work on multiple projects in Python, as one critical version/dependency for one project can cause your other projects to stop working. And, the process of uninstalling packages and/or switching versions for projects is tedious and time-consuming. "
