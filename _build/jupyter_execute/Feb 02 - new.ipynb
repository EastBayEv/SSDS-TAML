      "1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of San Marino was held at the 6th meeting, on 29 October 2014. The delegation of San Marino was headed by Pasquale Valentini, Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on San Marino. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of San Marino: Burkina Faso, Chile, China. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of San Marino: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/1); \n",
      "(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/2); \n",
      "(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/3). \n",
      "4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to San Marino through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process \n",
      " A. Presentation by the State under review \n",
      "5. The delegation of San Marino presented its report for the second cycle of the UPR on the human rights situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. The delegation noted that, in July 2014, it had presented the national report prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Health, Labour and Education and other government offices. It stated that the national report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first review, noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those recommendations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order. The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that, in the field of human rights, did not need internal implementation rules, as international law was an integral part of national law, and even superseded this in the event of any conflict.  \n",
      "\n",
      "8. The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted. On 1 July 2010, San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing it. On 21 July 2011, it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). On 23 October 2013, it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and, on 5 September 2014, approved Law No. 138 on ÒRegulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of GenocideÓ. In recent years, San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments: the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse; the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. Furthermore, San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No. 16 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments. \n",
      "\n",
      "9. Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein, the delegation announced that, having ratified on 21 July 2011 the amendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute, on the crime of aggression, was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament.  \n",
      "\n",
      "10. The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol. It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed, though, owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation, the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved, San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession. \n",
      "\n",
      "11. The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence, through the approval of Law No. 97 of 20 June 2008 on ÒPrevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violenceÓ, which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence, stalking and trafficking in human beings, and modified the offence of enslavement. The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation. The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed. The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which deals with issues related to awareness-raising and the promotion of legislative and non-legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens. \n",
      "\n",
      "12. On 31 May 2012, a decree was adopted to implement the above-mentioned Law. The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "13. The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino.  \n",
      "\n",
      "14. In addition, the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15. The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law, by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers.  \n",
      "\n",

Establishing a procedure to determine refugee status would prove problematic owing to the lack of border control between Italy and San Marino. \n",
      "\n",
      "62. In the case of foreigners who were unable to return to their home countries, he said that the Government of San Marino may issue an extraordinary stay permit for humanitarian and social protection reasons issued on a case-by-case basis. Beneficiaries \n",

      "67. Regarding the question of single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that, in San Marino, there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples.

Due consideration had also been given to single-parent families by allowing single people to adopt children. \n",
      "\n",
      "68. The Minister said that a national debate, encouraged by civil society, was ongoing about same-sex unions.

      "\n",
      "71.

      "\n",
      "73. The Minister said that, for the time being, San Marino did not intend to adhere to or ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ICRMW, nor the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. \n",
