# # **Appendix**
# 
# * Welcome to the appendix! Here you'll find instructions/guides to various Python techniques, tasks, and operations. If you have any suggestions as to what you'd like a section to be written about, please let us know! ad2weng@stanford.edu would be happy to receive your feedback! 

# ## Appendix A: *Virtual environments in Python*
# 
# When operating in Python, you'll often hear/read the advice that you should set up a "virtual environment" for each project you are working on. What exactly is a virtual environment, and why do you need one for every project? 
# 
# * From Python's official documentation: 
# 
#     * A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a "system" Python; i.e., the version of Python which is installed as part of your operating system.  
# 
# Put another way, activating your project in a virtual environment allows it to become it's own self-contained application. A few advantages of doing this include: 
# 
# * Allows you to download packages into your project without administrator privileges/status. 
# 
# * Compartmentalizes your project materials for easy sharing and replication. 
# 
# * *Avoids inter-project conflicts regarding versions and dependencies for packages.*
# 
# That last point can become especially relevant as you work on multiple projects in Python, as one critical version/dependency for one project can cause your other projects to stop working. And, the process of uninstalling packages and/or switching versions for projects is tedious and time-consuming. 

# With the benefits demonstrated, how exactly do we go about setting up a virtual environment? So glad you asked! 

# ### Appendix A.1: *Virtual environments in Anaconda*
# 
# Anaconda is the preferred distribution for local Python installs, with many functionalities presented in a user-friendly interface and offering a suite of applications to aid in data science projects. You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
# 
# 
# #### A.1.1: *Setting up a virtual environment*
# * Once you've downloaded Anaconda, you can set up a virtual environment by: 
# 
#     1. Open Anaconda Navigator on your computer. 
# 
#     2. On the left-hand side of the Navigator window, find and click on the button that say 'Environments': 
#     
#         <div>
#         <img src="fall2022/img/ana_env.png" width="500"/>
#         <div>
# 
#     3. In the 'Environments' page, go to the bottom-left of the page and click the button that says 'Create'.
# 
#         * When you do so, you'll be prompted by a pop-up window to provide a name for your new virtual environment. The location for the virutal environment will be shown to you, and you can install a specific version of Python and/or R: 
#         
#             <div>
#             <img src="fall2022/img/test_env.png"/>
#             <div>
# 
#         * Click the 'Create' button in the pop-up window, and wait for the virtual environment to finish being created.  

# #### A.1.2: *Activating your virtual environment*
# Now you're ready to use your virtual environment! To work in this environment, anytime you open Anaconda: 
# 
# * Navigate to the 'Environments' page; 
# 
# * Find the environment you want to use; and 
# 
# * Click on it!

# #### A.1.3: *Adding packages to your virutal environment*
# 
# To install packages in this virtual environment, either: 
# 
# * Stay on the 'Environments' page, and on the right-hand side of the page:
#      
#      * Change the field dictating displayed packages to 'Not installed' or 'All': 
# 
#           <div>
#           <img src="fall2022/img/packages_ana_env.png" width="500"/>
#           <div>
# 
#      * Go to the 'Search Packages' field and type in the name(s) of the package you want to install; 
# 
#      * If your package is available, click the open checkbox to the left of the package name: 
# 
#           <div>
#           <img src="fall2022/img/install_numpy_base.png" width="500"/>
#           <div>
# 
#      * Once you've selected all of the packages of interest, click the 'Apply' button in the bottom right-hand corner of the page to install them.  
# 
# * Go to the 'Home' page, and (install and then) open the 'CMD.exe Prompt' program:
# 
#      * In your command prompt window, you'll see that you're operating in your previously-selected virtual environment: 
# 
#           <div>
#           <img src="fall2022/img/my_env_cmd_prompt.png" width="500">
#           <div>
# 
#      * In this window, type ``` pip install [name of package] ``` for each package you want to install/weren't able to install in the 'Environments' page. 

# ### Appendix A.2: *Virtual environments in Command Window*
# 
# If you prefer to run Python in a command window-type interface, you can still use virtual environments! For this purpose, I recommend the user-friendly [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) package (which utilizes the ```pip``` and ```virtualenv``` packages, but handles most of the nitty-gritty details so you don't have to).
# 
# Let's take a look at how to use it: 

# #### A.2.1: *Installation prerequisites* 
# 
# To use the ```pipenv``` package, there's some other things we need to take care of first: 
#   
#   * Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If you don't, you should download the latest [version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before proceeding. 
# 
#   * Open a command window: 
# 
#     * On Windows devices, you can access this interface through the 'Command Prompt' program or the 'Windows Powershell' program. 
# 
#     * On Apple devices, a similar interface is avaialbe through the 'Terminal' application.   
#   
#   * Make sure Python is installed and recognized by your device by typing the ```py``` command in the command window. You should be greeted by a message which looks something like this: 
# 
#       <div>
#       <img src="fall2022/img/cmd_py_welcome.png" width="500"/>
#       <div>
#      
#     which displays the current version of Python running and some other information.
# 
#     * Running Python from a command window still lets you do all the wonderful Pythonic things you might want to! Writing functions, running scripts, etc. For example: 
# 
#         <div>
#         <img src="fall2022/img/cmd_py_testfunc.png" width="500"/>
#         <div>
#   
#     * Most people treat Python in the command window as a lightweight test IDE/calculator. Feel free to play around with it! 
# 
#   * If you see a similar "version (misc. info) [misc. info]" message, your Python installation is ready to go! Please reach out for help  troubleshooting if you don't. 

# #### A.2.2: *Installing pipenv*
# 
# Now that you've installed Python and can access it from a command window, you're ready to install pipenv. 
# 
# * First, install the ```pip``` package to unpack the ```pipenv``` package. 
#   
#     * If you're not sure as to whether you've installed ```pip``` or not, in your any command window Python instance, type and enter ```import pip```. 
#   
#     * If no errors rise or nothing happens, you're good to go! 
# 
# * Exit the Python instance you're currently running in your command window by executing "exit() + Enter" or "Ctrl + Z + Enter." 
# 
# * Install ```pipenv``` by typing and entering: ```py -m pip install pipenv```. 
# 
# That's it! ```pipenv``` has been installed and you're ready to set up virtual environments. 

# #### A.2.3: *Using pipenv*
# 
# ```pipenv``` allows you to control virutal environment creation and package installation and versioning all from the same interface. Let's go through some of the most common operations in ```pipenv``` for virtual environment management: 
# 
# 0. **Navigate to your project directory:** 
#   
#     * ```pipenv``` keeps all of your virutal environments separate by hashing the path of your current working directory. So, before you create a new virtual environment, be sure to navigate to the directory where you want all of the materials for your current project/workflow to be stored. 
# 
#     * After you've created your virtual environment for that project (by following the rest of the guide below), it will automatically be re-initialized anytime you navigate to that same working directory and open a ```pipenv``` shell in itâ€”read on for more about that!
# 
# 1. **Creating a virtual environment:**
# 
#     * To create a new virtual environment, simply enter the command ```py -m pipenv shell```. This will instantiate a new virtual environment (and a shell/command window in that environment) if one doesn't already exist. You should see a screen that looks like this: 
# 
#         <div>
#         <img src="fall2022/img/cmd_pipenv_new_venv.png" width="500"/>
#         <div>
# 
#     * In the sub-shell, you will be able to see the name of the new virtual environment prefixed before the working directory path. In the  image above, my new virtual environment is called ```ad2we-Y4yP-kYp```.
# 
#     * Then, be sure to install ```pipenv``` in your sub-shell (confusing, I know, but your virtual environment is sealed off from your local machine - it doens't know you have ```pipenv``` installed upstairs!) Executing ```py -m install pipenv``` in your subshell will do the trick. 
#   
# 2. **Installing packages:**
#    
#    * Now in your virtual environment sub-shell, installing packages with ```pipenv``` is just like installing packages with ```pip```:
# 
#         * If you don't need a particular version of a package, just type ```pipenv install <name of package>```:
#             
#             <div>
#             <img src="fall2022/img/cmd_pipenv_np_install.png" width="500"/>
#             <div>
#         
#         * If you need a particular version of a package, you can enter ```pipenv install <name of package>==<version number>```:
# 
#             <div>
#             <img src="fall2022/img/cmd_pipenv_flask_install.png" width="500"/>
#             <div>
# 
#         * Uninstalling packages can be done by executing ```pipenv uninstall <name of package>```.
# 
# 3. **Locking the environment:** 
#    
#    * In your virutal environment shell, you can run scripts, write functions, edit files, etc. as usual. Once you've completed your workflow, you can *lock* the versions of the different packages you have installed to ensure that you and others can always replicate your work without having to worry about versioning issues. 
# 
#    * Run the command ```pipenv lock``` â€” this will generate/update a file called ```Pipfile.lock``` which you should never need to edit manually. This file lists all the package versions, dependencies, and other computer-useful information used at the exact moment your ran the ```pipenv lock``` command. 
# 
#    * Anytime after running ```pipenv lock```, if you'd like to restore this locked environment (say, when opening a new command window and resuming work on a project), you can run the command:
#  
#         ```pipenv install --ignore-pipfile```  
#   
#    * which bypasses the Pipfileâ€”a file that contains only general information about required packagesâ€”to re-initalize the exact environment present when your previously locked development in this project directory. 

# ## Appendix B: *More on text preprocessing*
# 
# While the exact steps you elect to use for text preprocessing will ultimately depend on applications, there are some more generalizable techniques that you can usually look to apply: 
# 
# * **Expand contractions** - contractions like "don't", "they're", and "it's" all count as unique tokens if punctuation is simply removed (converting them to "dont", "theyre", "its", respectively). Decompose contractions into their constituent words to get more accurate counts of tokens like "is," "they," etc. (or for ensuring their removal when omitting stopwords from text -- read on for more about those!)
# 
#     * The [contractions](https://github.com/kootenpv/contractions) package can be useful here! Let's see an example:   
# 

# In[ ]:


# required install: 
get_ipython().system('pip install contractions')


# In[ ]:


import contractions 

contractions_sentence = "I'd like to know how you're doing! You're her best friend, but I'm your friend too, aren't I?"

# let's see the text, de-contraction-afied!
print(contractions.fix(contractions_sentence))

# this package can also resolve some slang! an example in action: 
slang_sentence = "Ima go sign up for an SSDS consult - yall gotta do it too!"

print(contractions.fix(slang_sentence, slang=True))


# * If you ran the previous code cell, you might notice that one of the contraction expansions in ```contractions_sentence``` isn't quite grammatically correct; "aren't I?" is coverted to "are not I?" where it should be "am I not?"
#  
#     * This is because the ```contractions``` package only offers *static* contraction conversions--i.e., it doesn't consider the context surrounding a contraction and always converts a specific contraction into a specific expansion. 
# 
#     * For a package that converts contractions with more contextual analysis, consider the [pycontractions](https://pypi.org/project/pycontractions/) package. Where multiple expansions are possible, this package evaluates which expansions are gramatically correct and then which one is most likely to be correct (by a metric called [Word Mover's Distance](https://towardsdatascience.com/word-distance-between-word-embeddings-cc3e9cf1d632)).
# 
#     * If you would like to use ```pycontractions```, be note that the install can be rather finnicky--the package requires another module called ```language-check``` which requires an up-to-date version of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html). If you have issues during the install, please reach out to SSDS for help! 

# * **Remove stopwords** - stopwords are words like "a," "from," and "the" which are typically filtered out from text before analysis as they do not meaningfully contribute to the content of a document. Leaving in stopwords can lead to irrelevant topics in topic modeling, dilute the strength of sentiment in sentiment analysis, etc. 
# 
#     * Here's a quick loop that can help filter out the stopwords from a string: 

# In[ ]:


from nltk.corpus import stopwords 
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

example_sentence = "Hi! This is a needlessly wordy sentence with lots of stopwords. My favorite words are: a, the, with, which. You may think that is strange - and it is!"

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

print("Example stopwords include: " + str(stopwords.words('english')[:5])) # if you want to see what are considered English stopwords by the NLTK package

word_tokens = word_tokenize(example_sentence)

filtered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w.lower() in stop_words]

# let's see the difference!
print(word_tokens)
print(filtered_sentence)


# * Note that different packages have different lists which define stopwords, so make sure you pick a suitable one. Also, feel free to define your own custom stopwords lists!  
# 
# * **Standardize phrases** - oftentimes text preprocessing is carried out as a precursor to a matching exercise (e.g. using company name to merge two databases). In such cases, we may want to standardize key phrases. For example, "My Little Startup, LLC" and "my little startup" clearly refer to the same entity, but will not match currently. 
# 
#     * In such cases, we may need to write a custom script to standardize key phrases, or there may be a packages out there that already do this for us. Let's take a look at one for our example, standardizing company names: 

# In[ ]:


# required install: 
get_ipython().system('pip install cleanco')


# In[ ]:


from cleanco import basename

business_name_one = "My Little Startup, LLC"
cleaned_name_one  = basename(business_name_one) # feel free to print this out! just add: 'print(cleaned_name_one)' below. 

business_name_two = "My Little Startup"
cleaned_name_two  = basename(business_name_two)

# sanity check - are the cleaned company names identical?  
print(cleaned_name_one == cleaned_name_two)


# * How and where you choose to standardize phrases in text will of course depend on your end goal, but there are plenty of resources/examples out there for you to model an approach after if a package doesn't already exist!
# 
# * **Normalize text** - normalization refers to the process of transforming text into a canonical (standard) form. Sometimes, people take this to mean the entire text pre-processing pipeline, but here we're using it to refer to conversions like "2mrrw" to "tomorrow" and "b4" to "before." 
# 
#     * This process is especially useful when using social media comments as your base text for analysis but often requires custom scripting.
