    "\n",
    "When operating in Python, you'll often hear/read the advice that you should set up a \"virtual environment\" for each project you are working on. What exactly is a virtual environment, and why do you need one for every project? \n",
    "\n",
    "* From Python's official documentation: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a \"system\" Python; i.e., the version of Python which is installed as part of your operating system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, activating your project in a virtual environment allows it to become it's own self-contained application. A few advantages of doing this include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows you to download packages into your project without administrator privileges/status. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Compartmentalizes your project materials for easy sharing and replication. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Avoids inter-project conflicts regarding versions and dependencies for packages.*\n",
    "\n",
    "That last point can become especially relevant as you work on multiple projects in Python, as one critical version/dependency for one project can cause your other projects to stop working. And, the process of uninstalling packages and/or switching versions for projects is tedious and time-consuming. "

    "\n",
    "```pipenv``` allows you to control virutal environment creation and package installation and versioning all from the same interface. Let's go through some of the most common operations in ```pipenv``` for virtual environment management: \n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Navigate to your project directory:** \n",
    "  \n",
    "    * ```pipenv``` keeps all of your virutal environments separate by hashing the path of your current working directory. So, before you create a new virtual environment, be sure to navigate to the directory where you want all of the materials for your current project/workflow to be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * After you've created your virtual environment for that project (by following the rest of the guide below), it will automatically be re-initialized anytime you navigate to that same working directory and open a ```pipenv``` shell in it—read on for more about that!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a virtual environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * To create a new virtual environment, simply enter the command ```py -m pipenv shell```. This will instantiate a new virtual environment (and a shell/command window in that environment) if one doesn't already exist. You should see a screen that looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/cmd_pipenv_new_venv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * In the sub-shell, you will be able to see the name of the new virtual environment prefixed before the working directory path. In the  image above, my new virtual environment is called ```ad2we-Y4yP-kYp```.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Then, be sure to install ```pipenv``` in your sub-shell (confusing, I know, but your virtual environment is sealed off from your local machine - it doens't know you have ```pipenv``` installed upstairs!) Executing ```py -m install pipenv``` in your subshell will do the trick. \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Installing packages:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Now in your virtual environment sub-shell, installing packages with ```pipenv``` is just like installing packages with ```pip```:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * If you don't need a particular version of a package, just type ```pipenv install <name of package>```:\n",
    "            \n",
    "![](img/cmd_pipenv_np_install.png)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * If you need a particular version of a package, you can enter ```pipenv install <name of package>==<version number>```:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/cmd_pipenv_flask_install.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Uninstalling packages can be done by executing ```pipenv uninstall <name of package>```.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Locking the environment:** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * In your virutal environment shell, you can run scripts, write functions, edit files, etc. as usual. Once you've completed your workflow, you can *lock* the versions of the different packages you have installed to ensure that you and others can always replicate your work without having to worry about versioning issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Run the command ```pipenv lock``` — this will generate/update a file called ```Pipfile.lock``` which you should never need to edit manually. This file lists all the package versions, dependencies, and other computer-useful information used at the exact moment your ran the ```pipenv lock``` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Anytime after running ```pipenv lock```, if you'd like to restore this locked environment (say, when opening a new command window and resuming work on a project), you can run the command:\n",
    " \n",
    "        ```pipenv install --ignore-pipfile```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "   * which bypasses the Pipfile—a file that contains only general information about required packages—to re-initalize the exact environment present when your previously locked development in this project directory. "
